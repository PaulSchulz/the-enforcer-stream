#+TITLE: The Enforcer Channel and the Leaf Spring Army

* Introduction
Welcome! This repository is here to hold the files for various 'fan based'
projects for The Enforcer Youtube Stream and The Leaf Spring Army.

The Enforcer is a Youtube Channel which regularly (daily) streams news from the
Internet about global events and issues. It started on February 22 2022, when
Russia invaded Ukraine after previously annexing Crimea.

The news stream is produced and presented by:

The Leaf Spring Army (LSA) is the name for the community of the stream. For the
origins of this name, please watch Day 27 of The Enforcer stream from the 1 hour
mark. It is also worth reading the comments as they were posted.
