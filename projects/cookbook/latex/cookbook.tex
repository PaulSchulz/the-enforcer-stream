\part{Introduction}

\textbf{From the Editor}

It has been said\footnote{attributed to Napoleon Bonaparte} that an army marches on it's stomach. 
The Leaf Spring Army Cookbook has been has been prepared to keep the 
LSA marching on. (The Leaf Spring Army will never die!)

In these pages you will find recipes from members of the LSA community. 
They may be a favourite Ukrainian recipe,
or a recipe that means something special from their own family and community.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has made a contribution.

We pause to remember those people fighting for Ukraine. We look forward to the day that
they will be able to enjoy their own food and culture again without the threat of war
over their heads.

\chapter{The Leaf Spring Army}

You are a member of the LSA if you Like and Subscribe to The Enforcer Youtube channel.
At last count there are almost 250,000 members.

The name of the \textbf{Leaf Spring Army} (or LSA) was put forward in the live chat
in response to the question - What should we call the community of channel members? 

\textbf{@The Enforcer} in an earlier stream had commented ``Is that a leaf spring?!!'',
referring to a wrecked Russian truck, thinking that this suspension type only existed on
older obsolete vehicles (Day 27 1h10s)\footnote{In the following pages, references have been provided to points 
in the stream, in the form ``(Day 27 1h10s)'', which for example,
refers to a point 1 hour and 10 seconds into the stream on that day.}.

The live chat of the stream spent the next two days riffing on ``Leaf Springs''.

The name stuck.

% \chapter{Definitions, In-Jokes, Gags and Memes}

\section{Definitions}

New members of the LSA are often confused by the large number of community in-jokes, memes etc, 
used in the The Enforcer Stream. The following list has been included to assist the new 
member (or help refresh the memory of The Old Guard).

\begin{description}
\item[LSA] The Leaf Spring Army. The community of people who Like 
  and Subscribe to the ``The Enforcer'' Youtube Channel.
  You are a member of the LSA if you Like and Subscribe to the channel.

\item[LLTLSA] Long Live the LSA (the Leaf Spring Army will never die).

\item[Morse Code] At the beginning of the live stream introduction, a message in
  morse code is played over a background of an air-raid siren and explosions.
  Listeners are encouraged to decode and post the answer in the live chat of the
  stream. Decoders are awarded with "ding ding ding, that's the sound of money"
  during the stream.

\item [Day of the War in Ukraine] The Enforcer Stream tracks the war by days since the
  Russians invaded Ukraine on the 24th February, 2022 (Day 1)

\item [Snake Island] Early in the war (Day 1) the Russians went to take 
Snake Island in the Black See. The response by the Ukrainian soldiers stationed 
on the island was ``Russian warship, go fuck yourself!''. This defiant action 
was later made into a postal stamp by Ukrposhta (the Ukrainian Postal Service).
   
\item [The Moskva] The first of Russia's new Black Sea submarine fleet.

\item [The Ukraine Tractor Corp] During the early stages of the war, Ukrainian farmers 
  were observed removing disabled Russian tanks from the battle field with their tractors. 

\item [Buy a Car] Also known as ``Buy that car'', ``Buy Matt a Car'',  ``Buy tractor..'' and ``Bayraktar''. 
  This is the name of a song used in the stream introduction that has also been called the theme song
  on the Cult of Matt.

\item [Cult of Matt] This usually refers to comments in live chat of the YouTube stream 
  where the Cult of Matt is seen as a replacement
  to religious and political discussion which has been banned in the channel. @EnforcerMatt
  religiously bans bots and trolls in the live chat that break these rules.

\item[Bobcats \bobcat]  Special vehicle losses (aka. bobcats) are a highlight of the
daily Russian casualty report.

\item [2 Group 2 Group]

\item [Mr Lunch Time]

\item[Don]
 
\item[Vlad, Tha FAILBOAT Caputin!!]

\item [The Leaf Spring Army Sends Its Regards] A donation to ``Sign My Rocket'' for a
  155mm artillary shell was made on behalf of the LSA. This shell was signed with the 
  message ``The Leaf Spring Army Sends Its Regards'' and it's ``sending'' is 
  shown during the streams introduction. 

\item[Hotdog Man] (Enough said, if you don't know, ask in the live stream chat.)

\item[The Marmot (Alan)]  Alan! Alan! Alan! Hello. Would you like a plum? 
  (Day 674 2h24m18s)

\item[Eating a succulent Chinese meal] ``Democracy Manifest'' Youtube Internet Meme
- Jack Karlson (1942 – 7 August 2024)

\item[The Old Guard] A channel member is considered a member of the Old Guard if they have 
  been watching the channel from the very early days of the war.  

\item [Scooby-Doo Van]

\item [eeGGooRR]

\item [FPV(Drone)] First Person View drone, where the pilot flies the drone while wearing goggles and
  viewing the flight of the drone through a front facing camera. 

\item[Blayt] As reported by the FPV Drone footage (yes, we have video evidence), this is 
  commonly the last thing a Russian soldier says on the front line before being added to the
  statistics. 

\item[UWD] Ukrainian War Discussion - Discord server supporting the LSA Community.
