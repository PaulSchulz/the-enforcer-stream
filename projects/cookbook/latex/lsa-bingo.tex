\section{Bingo}

To play LSA Bingo, draw a 5x5 grid BINGO card (as below). 

Mark the centre square as 'FREE' (some people use a star). 
This can be used to get a BINGO on the diagonals, in the 'N' column, or on the 3rd row.
Fill in the remaining squares with words and phrases from the list below, or make up
your own.

As \textbf{@The Enforcer} and \textbf{@EnforcerMatt} present the stream, cross off the boxes as you 
hear the word or phrase.

If you are able to cross of \textbf{5 boxes in a row}, horizontally, vertically or diagionally 
(including the 'FREE' square), yell \textbf{BINGO} as loud as you can, and put an `LSA BINGO' in the chat.
