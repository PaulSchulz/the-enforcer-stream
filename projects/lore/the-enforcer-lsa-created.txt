         1h32m32s The Enforcer comments on what is being said in chat.

  "I took a break during that video to look at the chat and I
  can see that you have all become huge fans of the whole leaf spring thing, so
  on top of 'coffee', and on top me saying 'that being said', it looks like that
  being said you have all become a huge fan of leaf springs. So pretty
  interesting that be what has caught on, so I am going to call you all the leaf
  spring gang, or the leaf spring battalion probably as time goes on, because
  that is a really interesting thing. Of all the things you could have picked
  you picked leaf spring. I just saw John Lindsay say 'May the leaf spring be
  with you' and I couldn't agree with you more. May the leaf springs be with
  you."

- Day 28 Leaf Springs are mentioned in the chat from the very beginning of the stream.
