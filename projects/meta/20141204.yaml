    Breaking news as the South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol conducted a
    military coup today by declaring martial law and attempting to arrest political
    opponents in the country. While theggg  situation is still very active, it appears
    that the martial law order has been revoked, but Yoon still looks to arrest
    political opponents. Meanwhile the Russian navy has fled their naval base on the
    Coast of Syria as rebel forces have now acquired long range artillery capable of
    hitting the Russian fleet moored at Taurus. The Israeli ceasefire appears to
    have ended after Hezbollah and Israel kept firing after the ceasefire was
    supposed to be in effect. In Ukraine Russian forces have once again taken no
    real gains and suffered heavy losses in Kursk. -
