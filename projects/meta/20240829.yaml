  description: |
    Russia has been hit with massive attacks overnight as they continue to fire
    large numbers of missiles and drones into Ukrainian airspace. Major Russian oil
    depots are now raging infernos; crucial powerplants are now knocked out, and
    Russian firefighters are unable to control the blazes. Meanwhile Ukrainian
    forces continue to pin down the Russians south of Reka Seym, with Russia unable
    to push Ukraine out of Kursk. In Pokrovsk, Ukrainian forces are attempting to
    bring a stop to the Russian advance, and are inflicting high casualties on
    advancing forces.
