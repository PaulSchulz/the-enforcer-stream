    RUSSIAN DRONES HIT LATVIA AND ROMANIA, RUSSIA HIT HARD! Breaking War News With The Enforcer 928
  morse: |
    RUSSIA IS ONCE AGAIN LANDING DRONES IN NATO AND NOTHING IS
    BEING DONE ABOUT IT. WE SHOULD RESPOND
  description: |
    Russian drones have hit Latvia and Romania over the past few hours, causing
    grave concern amongst eastern NATO allies that the airspace may be in a very
    perilous state. Meanwhile Russia is still having a difficult time in the Kursk
    Oblast as they lose the Karyzh crossing today from an airstrike, and are still
    not able to properly stablilize the front. A major fuel depot was hit in
    Belgorod, it's smoke and flames reaching across the entire Olbast; blanketing it
    in a thick veil of smoke. Heavy fighting on most fronts is still underway with
    many Russians being lost in the pitched battles.
