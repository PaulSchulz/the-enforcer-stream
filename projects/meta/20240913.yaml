    PUTIN THREATENING WAR WITH THE WEST IS SO Y. I WONDER IF WE CROSSED
    THE RED LINE? WOMP WOMP. LSA!
  description: |
     Ukrainian forces just began a major push across the border in Kursk to
     crush the remaining Russian forces south of the Reka Seym. Preemptive measures
     were conducted with airstrikes targeting the last usable bridge over the river,
     and the offensive began only moments ago. Putin has threatened that war has now
     started between Russia and NATO as the UK has now authorized the use of long
     range weapons inside Russia. Meanwhile Ukrainian forces are hitting the Russians
     incredibly hard inflicting high casualties around the Pokrovsk and Bakhmut
     areas.
