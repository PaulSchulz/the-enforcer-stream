    Russian forces are rapidly being beaten back in Kursk as a new front has
    opened catching the Russians entirely off guard. Ukrainian forces are also
    inflicting massive losses on the Russians near Pokrovsk, as the fighting proves
    to be a defensive victory, the Russians are hardly advancing in this front if at
    all. Israel has stated it intends to conduct a full scale war against Hezbollah
    in the coming weeks. The United States has also stated they will soon allow
    Ukraine to use American weapons inside of Russia. This will be our last night on
    air until the 19th of September, we thank you all for sticking with us for 3
    years and hopefully many more. Long Live The LSA!
