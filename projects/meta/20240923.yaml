    A Russian Sarmat missile exploded on the launch pad overnight during a
    failed Russian nuclear weapons test; it is assumed the test did not go according
    to plan. Russian authorities are facing at the same time an incredibly serious
    situation as Russian forces are losing record numbers over the past day, such a
    serious loss that the Russian air force is risking aircraft to bomb Ukrainian
    positons in Kursk. Meanwhile Russian forces are bieng hit heavily near Pokrovsk,
    once again grinding their offensive to a halt.
