    Russia has lost the Russian colonel repsonsible for the growth of their
    drone forces, as he was gunned down in Moscow overnight, a serious blow to
    Russian strategic development. Meanwhile Russian forces took insanely high
    losses and were facing heavy destruction in the Pokrovsk offensive. Meanwhile
    Israel is ready to invade Lebanon at any minute now, as a mass buildup has been
    seen along the border. Nasrallah has been confirmed dead after yesterday's
    airstrike and Iran says they will most likely respond.
