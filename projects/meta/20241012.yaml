    battles completely destroyed a Russian advance aimed at the city. Meanwhile 3
    FSB agents were killed on the border of Chcchnya by armed militants, possibly
    linked to the blood feud announced by Kadyrov yesterday. Meanwhile Russian
    forces in Kursk attempt to hold the line as Ukraine holds their ground inside of
    Russia. Israel's attack appears to finally be ready and will be given the green
    light very soon. Major damage dwas documented at the Yeysk airfield.

  notes: |
    Sally the Sock Eyed Salmon - There was a story, but they have since just
    disappeared.

    Chris's Mum - Chris was banned for inappropriate comments, which lead to
    a reference to Chris's Mum.

    MagicSkyGirl - A nice viewer, until there was a political story about The
    Enforcer was spread by HotdogMan via the first discord server . Turned nasty,
    and they were eventually banned.
