    Shots rang out at the Korean border today while North Korea destroyed all road
    and railroad crossings into their country. The situation at the border is very
    tense and it seems that they are mere moments away from full out firefights
    beginning. Meanwhile Taiwan has been encircled by a swarm of Chinese aircraft
    and vessels, a day after military exercises were to end according to Chinese
    officials. Israel has finalized it's attack plan and awaits approval from the
    council for the final green light. Meanwhile in Ukraine Russian forces have
    taken very high losses, and are gaining no ground against Ukrainian forces.
