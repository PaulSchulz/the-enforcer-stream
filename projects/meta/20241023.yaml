    Russian forces have been slammed heavily by Ukrainian deep strikes, with
    the only chip manufacturer in Russia suffering serious damage along with a large
    alcohol distillery. Meanwhile North Korea is mobilizing millions as they have
    stated that the time for hostile action is now, and South Korea has given an
    ultimatum to North Korea to withdraw form the Ukraine War. A Russian Il-76 was
    shot down over Sudan with many government officials onboard killed. Israel is
    now only mere days away from their attack on Iran according to the Israeli
    government, and is continuing heavy strikes on Lebanon.
