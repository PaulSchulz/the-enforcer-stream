    THE AXIS OF EVIL MAY SEEM OF SOUND DESIGN, BUT THE CRACKS ALWAYS BUBBLE TO

    Chechnya has attacked a Russian convoy inside of their borders, killing 3 and
    causing the largest action of the blood feud so far between Russia and Chechnya.
    THis could begin to seriously degrade relations in the Southern Caucasus region
    and it could devolve into open revolt. Meanwhile South Korea has vowed payback
    against North Korea, stating they will be taking action against North Korea for
    recent escalations. Meanwhile in the Middle East a great deal of confusion has
    set in with conflicting reports saying Israel will not attack Iran and others
    saying the attack is happening in mere days. Iran states they will begin full
    scale war if attacked at all.
