    CHECHNYA GETTING HIT FROM FSB FORCES JUST ACROSS THE BORDER, SOUNDS LIKE
    DOMESTIC ABUSE TO ME. LONG LIVE THE LSA!
  description: |
    Russian drones have slammed into a Chechen Special forces school, causing
    the main building to be destroyed and causing the Chechens to announce they will
    be punishing the Ukrainians for the attack; however the Ukrainians have not
    admitted to the attack and all information leads to it being launched from a
    neighboring region. Meanwhile Moscow is conducting Nuclear drills with their
    ICBM forces, a thinly veiled threat towards America. Israel is continuing
    operations against Hezbollah, and North Korean forces are still heading towards
    Kursk.
