    Iran has issued a statement threatening nuclear war in the Middle East,
    creating a dangerous situation that may require outside intervention to quell.
    Meanwhile in Russia a mjaor oil refinery in the Don region has been hit, with
    toxic smoke rising into the air above the city. North Korea has made more
    statements today publicly solidifying their stance with the Russians, as more
    North Koreans are reportedly in Kursk fighting against Ukraine. Ukrainian forces
    are still continuing heavy defensive actions against the Russians, and are
    holding their ground.
