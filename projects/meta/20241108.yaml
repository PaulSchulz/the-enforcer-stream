    US forces are currently rapidly deplying into the middle east as a large
    number of transport aircraft have been landing in Northern Syria, and an F-15E
    fighter squad has also been deplyoed to Northern Jordan. The US appears to be
    preparing for the next major attack by the Iranians on Israel. Meanwhile in
    Ukraine a major Russian offensive in the Donetsk region near Siversk has been
    repelled, and Russian forces are still taking high losses. Other Russian forces
    in Kursk are still trying to push Ukraine out but are running into immovable
    defenses. Sotuh Korea is stating that they will most likely supply the
    Ukrainians with arms and other materials.
