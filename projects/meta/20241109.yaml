    Russia has bombed the Residence of the Estonian Ambassador to Ukraine in
    what appears to be a deliberate attack meant to incite an international
    incident. Estonia has made statements about the attack letting the public know
    that the ambassador is unharmed and in good health. Meanwhile the Russians are
    running out of weapons as North Korean light machine guns have arrived in very
    large numbers over the past day to the Kursk region. Meanwhile Israeli ground
    operations have been continuing in Lebanon with airstrikes hitting key HQ in
    Tyre. An assassination plot against the president elect made by Iran was foiled
    today.
