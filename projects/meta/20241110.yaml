    RUSSIAN DEFEAT ON ALL FRONTS? THEY DO NOT HAVE THAT DOG
    IN THEM, THAT DOG MAULED THEM. LLTLSA! 
  description: |
    Russian forces have suffered major defeats on all fronts as all offensive
    actions took insane losses, with Ukrainian defenders having successfully held
    their ground, making this day a major defensive victory for Ukraine. Russian
    forces in the Kursk and Siversk battlefields suffered the greatest losses at no
    gains. Russia has made an official treaty alliance with North Korea, while North
    Korea begins deploying GPS jammers near to the MDL and the DMZ. In the Middle
    East the Israelis are dismantling Hezbollah positions, and in Houthi terriotry
    airstrikes have hit Sanna'a.
