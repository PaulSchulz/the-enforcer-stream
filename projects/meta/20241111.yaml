    US THREATENS RUSSIA WITH WAR, MASS ATTACKS ON MOSCOW! Breaking War News With The
    Enforcer (991)

    RUSSIA GETTING A WARNING FROM AMERICA NOT TO ESCALATE IS REALLY SOMETHING. GET
    THE POPCORN! LLTLA
  description: |
    The United States has threatened the Russian Federation today with possible
    armed action if further escalations are made in the Kursk Region against
    Ukrainian Armed Forces. This could begin to create larger escalations in the
    broader conflict. Meanwhile a mass drone attack was conducted on Moscow, with
    nearly 40 Ukrainian drones making it into Moscow city, some hitting their
    targets while others were shot down. In Ukraine Russian forces have been facing
    very high losses as the Ukrainian defenses hold firm, and little signs of
    Russian progress are being seen.
