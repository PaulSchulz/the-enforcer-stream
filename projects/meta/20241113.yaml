    Hours ago US Warships were attacked by Iranian Proxies inside of yemen,
    firing anti ship missiles towards their direction. The Ships engaged and
    destroyed the anti ship missile barrage, and suffered no damage but it is
    believed that these were a part of a carrier group, and would be the first time
    such action has occured. Meanwhile the Russian Army has faced record high losses
    on the battlefield as they seek to put themselves in a decent position for
    negotiations, and are making nearly no ground. France will now provide Ukraine
    with six Mirage 2000-5F aircraft instead of the original 3 allocated.
