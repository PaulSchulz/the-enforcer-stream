    Breaking news as Russia is attacked for the first time by US-made ATACMS
    missiles, slamming down in Bryansk while Ukraine has pounded multiple military
    facilites in Belgorod and Voronezh simutaneously with drones. Russia is
    threatening the west and claiming that this means war with NATO as Putin has
    redrawn Russia's nuclear doctrine today during the attacks by Ukraine with the
    ATACMS. Losses are still mounting over the charred bettlefields as Russian
    forces hurridly attempt to take more ground before January, but Ukrainian
    defenses are slowing or still topping Russian advances on all fronts. Ukraine
    has even begun limited counterattacks to disorient Russian forces and further
    hamper any efforts to take ground. Today the the 1000th Day of the War In
    Ukraine, and will be a major celebration of the success of Ukrainian Armed
    Forces as well as the success of the western world's might against the axis
    powers.
