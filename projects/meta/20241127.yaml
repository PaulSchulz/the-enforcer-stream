    NATO PREPARES FOR WAR WITH RUSSIA, WAR IN LEBANON ENDS! Breaking War News With
    The Enforcer (1007)

    NATO IS READY FOR WAR BECAUSE THE REPUBLIC WILL NOT STAND FOR WHAT THE AXIS
    IS DOING. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Nato has begun preparations for war with Russia, as the diplomatic situation
    appears to have all but dissapeared and the Russian Federation seems to be
    hellbent on some armed response eventually. American negotiators have been able
    to finally secure a peace deal inside of Lebanon, with Israeli forces and
    Hezbollah concluding hostile actions only an hour ago. Russian forces are
    putting all the force they can msuter into the Kursk offensive but are hardly
    pushing Ukraine back, and taking high losses. Ukraine has now declared they will
    be conducting a counteroffensive due to the stabilization of the Kupyansk
    offensive which culminated in Russian Defeat.
