    MAJOR RUSSIAN DEFEAT IN SYRIA, RUSSIA SLAMMED WITH ATTACKS! Breaking War
    News W/ The Enforcer 1010
  description: |
    A major defeat has been suffered by Russian and Syrian forces at Aleppo as
    the entire city has fallen to SDF and SSG forces within only 72 hours, a major
    blow to the Asad regime and the Russian control of the middle east. Iran and
    Russia are considering more serious involvement in support of Asad although the
    crucial loss of Aleppo has shocked many Russians to the core. Bashar Al-Asad has
    already fled Syria showing that faith in the Syrian and Russian forces is
    nonexistant. Russia has been hit heavily in Crimea as Russian SAM sites were
    located and destroyed by Ukrainian attacks, Russian forces still make little to
    no progress in any active battles.
