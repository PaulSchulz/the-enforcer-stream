    Breaking news as the Republic of Syria is currently collapsing under attacks
    from the SDF and the SSG. Currently a coup is being conducted to overthrow Assad
    inside the Republic of Syria, and Assad according to all sources has fled
    Damascus and is currently in Moscow. Russia has removed their commander in Syria
    for incompetence and Russian forces are fleeing the country. In Russia
    explosions echo across the land as Ukrainian attacks hit Bryansk and other
    targets, the exact details of the damage are yet unknown but will emerge soon.
    Russian forces have taken insanely high losses in the past 24 hours.
