    With The Enforcer 1012
  morse: |
    SYRIA IS COLLAPSING SO QUICKLY RUSSIA IS PULLING OUT THE OLD TRICK OF BOMB
    EVERYONE. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Russia has resorted to desparate measures, carpet bombing the city of
    Aleppo today and causing massive civilian casualties in an attempt to help save
    the Dying Assad Regime. It appears this may be a hopeless endeavor as the Syiran
    Arab Army is still in complete tatters, and it attempting to retake Hama at the
    moment although rebel forces are fighting heavily. South of Aleppo SAA forces
    appear to be entirely broken as large numbers of prisoners have been taken. In
    Ukraine Russian forces attempt to drive Ukraine out of Kursk but suffer heavy
    losses, making no gains again and today's attacks defeated. In other areas the
    Russians are still attempting to push with no success.
