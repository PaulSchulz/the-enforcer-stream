    RUSSIA LOSES SYRIA, REBELS ENTER DAMASCUS; CIVIL WAR ENDS! Breaking War News
    With The Enforcer 1018
  morse: |
    A VICTORY FOR THE WEST AND THE ENTIRE WESTERN WORLD. THE
    RUSSIANS, IRAN, AND ASSAD DEFEATED. LLTLSA! 
  description: |
    Russian forces are packing up at Latakia onboard Russian transport planes as
    the capitol city of Damascus falls to the Druze rebels only moments ago. The
    Republic Guard of the
    Syrian Arab Army threw away their uniforms and put on
    their old clothes. Returning to their familiar homes but an unfamiliar future.
    Syrian forces also lost the city of Homs simultaneously, the last of the
    major cities under Assad's control. Yurkish forces may begin an offensive
    against the SDF in the near future. Meanwhile Yoon Suk Yeol in an unexpected
    turn of events has retained his power as the impeachment vote was unsuccessful,
    the former minister of defense has been arrested. In Ukraine Russian forces
    still march forward to the battlefield all the while knowing that the Russian
    Federation is a shell of it's former self much like Assad's Syria, and the end
    of the war in Ukraine and the end of Putin's.
