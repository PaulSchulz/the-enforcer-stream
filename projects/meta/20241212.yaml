    to intelligence in the area. it is unsure whether it will be kinteic or

    unknown origin continue to fill the skies, this has drawn mass attention of US
    congress members and the citizenry, with one congressman declaring that they are
    from a Iranian mother ship sitting off the coast in international waters. In
    Ukraine the Russians have taken consdierable losses and are still taking little
