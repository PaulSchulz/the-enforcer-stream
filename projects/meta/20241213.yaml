  description: |
    Overnight the Rostov Region of Russia has been hit heavily with ATACMS
    strikes inside of the region, as Russia is in the midst of perparing and
    launching another Oreshnik IRBM towards Ukraine. Russian forces are having a
    difficult time in the frigid winter weather making any real gains against the
    Ukrainian defense, and are unable to make ground. Meanwhile Israle has stated
    they are now preparing to bomb Iranian nuclear research and development sites
    after the major losses of the Syrian interim governments air defenses from
    Israeli attacks earlier this week. The Chinese simulated blockade of Taiwan
    appears to be ending, as NATO encourages nations to increase military spending
    in preparation for war.
