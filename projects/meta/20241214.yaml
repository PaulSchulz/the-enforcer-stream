    destroyed a major Russian oil depot in Orel, causing great devastation and chaos
    for the Russian's war fighting abilities. Meanwhile Russia launched a major
    attack on Ukraine, one of the largest of the war with msot of the drones and
    missiles being fired shot down over Ukrainian skies. Russian forces that were
    trapped in Northern Syria attempted to break for the port of Tartus, a daring
    move for survival. Nearly 130 Russian vehicles filled with supplies and troops
    make a bold dash for the coast, crossing the whole of Syria in it's path.
    Negotiations have fallen apart, and the Russians are now having to leave their
    airbase at tartus, and the details on port facilities is unknown at this time.
    Meanwhile the drone incident continues to draw the public's attention, some even
    firing at the drones in northern New Jersey.
