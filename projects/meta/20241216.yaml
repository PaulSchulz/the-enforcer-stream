      with their contents spreading across the Black sea in the hours to follow, the
      worst oil spill in the history of the Black Sea has begun. Hundreds of North
      Korean soldiers conducted a human wave attack against Ukrainian posiiotns in
      Kurskm large numbers of north Korean troops were lost and the attack was
      repelled. In two days the North Koreans have been proven to be combat
      ineffective. Ukrainian forces are holding their positions with great courage 
      against the Russian onslaughts. Battles are beginning to diminish in size but
      still ongoing along all fronts due to winter weather. In Syria Israeli forces
      bombed a ammo depot on the Syrian coast, creating a near nuclear size explosion.
