    STORM SHADOWS ARE MAKING SURE THE RUSSIANS ARE SEEING THE SHADOW
    OF THE OIL STORMS FORMING ABOVE THEM. LLTLSA!


  description: |
    Russia has been hit heavily in the Rostov Region as Storm Shadows have
    rained down on multiple strategic sites throughout the Oblast knocking out
    facilities vital for Russia's war machine and economy. The Russian Federation is
    overwhelmed by the attack, while major damage is being cause due to 3 oil tanker
    ssinking near the KErch strait, the damage now visible on Satellite. Russia is
    also working on making friendly fire less of an issue after North Korena
    soldiers have accidentally killed 8 Russians in a friendly fire incident. The
    Russian economy is still in freefall and the Russian Duma is openly blaming the
    central bank for the financial catastrophe.
