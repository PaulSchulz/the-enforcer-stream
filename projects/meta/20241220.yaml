  description: |
    Putin has threatened to strike Kyiv with IRBM missiles as Putin begins to
    dive into insanity due to the loss of the Russian Army in Ukraine. Russian
    forces continue to face insurmountable losses as North Korea attempts to send
    more troops; Russia does not want them. In Murmansk huge explosions were seen in
    Murmansk at the naval base, with the exact damage still unknown while the sun
    rises on the burning port. The US has announced that there are now 2,000 US
    forces inside of Syria. A NOTAM was issued for drone activi@Hugty in the entire
    area of Northern New Jersey, with lethal force authorized by the federal
    government to deal with incursions.
