  description: |
    Explosions have rocked Kaza, deep in the heart of Russia, as Ukrainian drone
    strikes continue to hammer the Russian Federation. Meanwhile US forces have
    conducted a large air attack on Houthi forces within Western Yemen, targeting
    key sites used by the Houthi forces for offensive attacks on maritime shipping.
    Russia has suffered very high losses in Ukraine while trying to take more
    ground. Some Russian forces are appearing to break under the pressures of winter
    fighting, and cannot give effective resistance.
