  morse: |
    THE REPUBLIC HAS BEEN ATTACKED,
    AND THE REPUBLIC SHALL STRIKE DOWN THOSE PEOPLE. LLTLSA! 
  description: |
    Major terror attacks have occurred in the cities of New Orleans and Las
    Vegas, as bombs exploded in front of the Trump International hotel in Las Vegas
    killing 7, and an assailant drove a pickup down Bourbon street running over
    pedestrians killing 15. Officials of the republic are responding quickly, with
    special teams dispatched by the FBI in Washington to assess the attacks and
    begin to create a national response to such heinous attacks. In Russia massive
    explosions have rung out across multiple cities, Ukraine has been slamming them
    in an attempt to destroy Russia's warfighting abilities. Russian forces are
    beginning to move into Libya in a last ditch attempt to hold onto Russia's
    possessions in west Africa.
