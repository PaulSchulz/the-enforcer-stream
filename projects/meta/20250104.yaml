    Russian forces have been pushed back at Pokrovsk after a Russian attack
    collapsed, and left a large opening for Ukrainian counterattack. The Russians
    have been pushed back to Novoselivka Persha, and are taking sizable losses on
    the battlefield. Russian forces in other fronts fare poorly, with no significant
    gains made, and only losses to show in exchange. US forces are moving around in
    Syria filling positions left by the Russians, and also conducting counter
    insurgency operations. The attempted arrest of Yoon Suk Yeol has ended, and
    Russian forces are moving their bases from Syria to Libya.
