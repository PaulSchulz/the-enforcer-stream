    UKRAINE IS AGAIN ON THE MARCH TO KURSK, HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE A SHORT
    ONE. LLTLSA

    A major Russian defeat has been suffered in Kursk as Ukrainian forces began
    an offesnive in the early morning hours, breaking the defensive lines of the
    810th Naval Infantry Brigade and inflicting heavy losses on North Korean
    Expeditionary forces. Currently the exact rate of advance is unknown, but panic
    has spread throughout the oblast. Russian civil authorities have ordered
    mandatory evacuations of areas as far away as 15 miles form the active front
    possibly showing the frontline siuation is grave and Russian forces are in a
    rout. Ukrainian forces have been able to conduct limited counteroffensives in
    the Chasiv Yar direction as well reclaiming small amounts of territory.
