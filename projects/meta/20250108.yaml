    in Los Angeles major fires are sweeping the north palisades distrcit of the
    city, many have succumed to the blaze, hundreds of acres are burning widly out
    of control, and the city has declared a tactical emergancy, diverting all
    firefighting and law enforcement efforts towards the north palisades area. In
    Ukraine frontline progress is still being made towards Bolshoe Soldastkoe, and
    Russian forces have taken incredibly high losses in the face of Ukrainian
    attacks.
