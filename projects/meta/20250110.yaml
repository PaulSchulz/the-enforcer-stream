    Russia has suffered tremendous losses in a failed assault in Kursk today as Ukrainian forces destroyed an entire assault company in less than 30 minutes, leaving the Russian attack off kilter and routing from the field. US intelligence has confirmed that 4,000 North Koreans have been lost in the Kursk battle in a very short duration of time. Ukraine launched a series of deep stirkes, hitting vital fuel supplies in Engels, an Army HQ in Donetsk, and other targets in Voronezh. Meanwhile NATO is deploying naval forces to the black sea to counter Russian threats to vital communication links, and Russian is unable to get their remaining equipment out of Syria. The day is 1051 of the war.
