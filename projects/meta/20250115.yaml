    On Day 1056 Russian oil refineries have been hit again throughout the
    entirety of the Russian federation, bringing the mighty Russian oil industry to
    it's knees, with nearly 20% of ail Russian refining capabilitites offline at
    this time. The Russian central bank has moved to freeze and liquidate personal
    savings over $13,300, the state Duma is attempting to stop this measure, a last
    gasp of air for a financially dead country. South Korea has successfully
    arrested Yoon Suk Yeol, with his motorcade arriving at the justice center in
    Seoul today, ending a precarious situation in the South Korean government. North
    Korea fired a ballistic missile, and Germany is approving the shooting down of
    any drones over secure areas. France is considering the deployment of
    peacekeeping troops in Ukraine.
