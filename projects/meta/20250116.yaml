    THE WEST MUST WORK TOGETHER TO UNCOVER AND FOIL ANY
    RUSSIAN PLOTS OF TERROR. LLTLSA! 
  description: |
    The Polish government has announced that they have discovered a sinsiter
    plot by the Russian federation to begin attacking global airlines around the
    world in an attempt to stirke back at the west; with innocent civilians their
    primary target. This comes as Russian inflation rates hit 10% today, showing the
    Russian economy, despite their best efforts, is beginning to enter an
    uncontrollable spiral to economic failure. Russian forces have taken
    considerable losses on the frontline as they still fail to break through
    Ukrainian lines. NATO has deployed a special fleet to the baltic with the aims
    of stopping further damage to vital infrastructure.
