    RUSSIA PREPARING FOR WAR WITH WEST, ISRAEL TO STRIKE IRAN! Breaking War
    News W/ The Enforcer

    WE MUST PREPARE FOR THE WORST AND BE READY TO FACE THE RUSSIANS
    IF NEEDED. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Russia is preparing for an all out wat with the west according
    to the German general of the German Army. This seems possible as overt actions
    by the Russian Federation in prior days appear to be showing a far more hostile
    stance towards NATO, and trenches are already being created within western
    Balrus; a sign of possible war. Israel is soon to strike Iranian nuclear
    facilites as it seems to have recieved the green light from the incoming
    president of the US, and there are reports that the US will assist in planning
    the operation. South Korea is dealing with civil unrest as the trial of fromer
    president Yoon is underway. In Iran, a supposed Super bunker appears to be far
    less than that. Today is day 1060 of the war.
