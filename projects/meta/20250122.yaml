  description: |
    The Smolensk Aviation Facotry, which produces SU-25 and cruise missiles has
    been hit by Ukrainian drones causing significant damage to the factory and
    rendering it largely inoperable in some of the assembly halls. Ukraine has also
    been able to conduct a successful maritime blockade of Crimea, with Russian
    carge now unable to arrive in any port inside the peninsula. Russia has also had
    their port access rights in Syria revoked, but the interim government is
    allowing them to finally evacuate their remaining forces from Tartus. Russian
    forces are taking losses on all fronts, as Ukrainian defense remain resolute.
    The United States will continue foreign support to Ukraine, as they have been
    provided and exemption from the Secretary of State during the foreign funding
    freeze ordered by the President for the next 90 days.
