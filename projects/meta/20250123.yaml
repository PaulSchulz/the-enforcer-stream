    The US has issued an ultimatum to the Russian Federation that they can either
    end the war or suffer an economic collapse and military defeat at the hands of
    the United States. Russia is resounding with a clear and hard no at the moment,
    and US support arrived in Poland today to continue to support Ukrainian forces.
    Because of this, Russia has requested mroe reinforcements from North Korea, and
    North Korea has accpeted, sending even more soldiers into Russia to be
    integrated into the front lines. The Toyal navy detected and forcefully turned
    away a Russian spy ship, which was trying to scan underwater platforms and
    systems.
