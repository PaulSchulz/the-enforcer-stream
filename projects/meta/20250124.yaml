    Today the President of the United States warned the NATO alliance that all
    member states must urgently increase military spending to 5% of national GDP
    effective immediately. This comes after an "important phone call" was placed by
    Putin which may have indicated to the US that Russia may be going down a hostile
    path. In Moscow Putin rushed back to the Kremlin only a few hours ago as
    Ukrainian drones conducted a major attack on Russian infrastructure, targetins
    major refineries and also the city of Moscow itself. A US C-17 flew to ISrael,
    and then to Rsezow, carrying an unknown cargo. Ukrainian forces are still
    inflicting high losses onto the Russian Armed forces along all fronts.
