    NAZPOM IS BEGGING FOR THE PRICES TO FCREASE BUT SOON THE PRICES WILL FALL.
    LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Gazprom has publicly announced that they need to increase fuel and oil
    prices, otherwise they will soon declare bankruptcy, plunging the entire economy
    into financial collapse. So far the Russian federation has not responded to the
    request, and is adamant on continuing the war in Ukraine in light of more severe
    sanctions coming down the road. The United States has deployed a THAAD Battery
    to Poland, and is considering giving Ukraine 330 Billion dollars in frozen
    Russian assets. Ukraine has inflicted high casualties onto Russian forces in the
    prior day.
