    NO MATTER WHICH WAY YOU CUT IT THEY JUST AREN'T 
    DOING GOOD ANYMORE. I LIKE IT! LLTLSA!

    The Russian Army is trapped in Kursk as their own tank traps stop them from
    advancing farther on Ukrainian forces. Putin has begun to panic over US threats
    to Russia continuing the war, as Ukraine has not been cut off from US military
    aid according to President Zelensky and the Ukrainian government. Russian forces
    are having difficult times breaking through Ukrainian lines, although a small
    advance was made into Velyka Novosilka today. Russian armed forces continue to
    suffer high losses, and an endless stream of North Korean equipment continues to
    flow into western Russia. North Korea tested a new missile today, and the US is
    beginning to kill the Russian natural gas business in Europe as US tankers
    arrive today with fresh natrual gas.
