    THE DAY THEY ARE GOING TO CONSUME THE LAST DROP OF OIL AND
    THEY WILL WEEP FOR THERE IS NO MORE. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Ukraine has conducted a new wave of serious attacks against Russian
    pipelines, knocking out 2 of them today and ensuring that the Russian federation
    is no longer able to ensure it's vital economic lifeline. A state of panic is
    now descending across Russia as the country realizes that the war will go on,
    but Russian cannot. North Koreans were recalled for retraining because of large
    amounts of insubordination and stealing that occured between them and the
    Russians. A US airliner crashed in the Potomac in Washington DC after colliding
    with a helicopter.
