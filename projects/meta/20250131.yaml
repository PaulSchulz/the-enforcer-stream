  morse: |
    YOU CAN SEE JUST HOW SORELY MISSED NORTH KOREANS ARE BY
    THE WAY UKRAINE HITS THE RUSSIANS HARDER. LLTLSA! 
  description: |
    Ust Luga, the largest Russian oil port, has shut down today after fuel
    supplies and reserves have collapsed in storage capacity across Russia. This
    port accounts for 20% of all exports of Russian oil. The Russian federation
    appears to be panicking, and has ramped up offensive efforts in Kursk after the
    withdrawal of North Korean soldiers. This has gone poorly, as heavy losses have
    been taken, and the Russian attack was forced to retreat. In Syria, the Interim
    government is demanding of Russia the return of Assad and reparations for war
    damages. Russian ICBM's are reportedly facing major issues.
