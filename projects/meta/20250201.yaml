  description: |
    Russian oil companies have shut down operations of some of the largest
    plants in the Russian federation as serious financial losses coupled with
    Ukraine's devastation of oil inftrastructure is leading some leading oil
    manfufacturers to shutter damaged refineries well into the future. A major crash
    happened in Philadelphia as a Learjet air ambulance crashed only moments after
    taking off from the Philidelphia airport. Iran is threatneing open war with the
    United States, as the US has announced that they will retake the Panama canal.
    Ukrainian forces have inflicted heavy losses for another day onto the Russian
    army, which are taking little to no ground in most areas, and it seems that the
    Rsusians are once again desperate to acheive meaningful gains.
