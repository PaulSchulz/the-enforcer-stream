    The US has announced they are allowing Ukraine to conduct unlimited deep strikes
    anywhere in the Russian Federation after a deal was struck for the US to recieve
    Ukrainian rare earths. Shoking news has been unearthed about Iranian missiles,
    it appears the newest model is largely a North Korean Kwasong design, meaning
    that North Korea has given Iran nuclear missile tech of their own. In Ukraine
    the armed forces have inflicted heavy losses onto the Russian military, and
    Russian forces have made little to no ground. Russia is enraged at the United
    States, and has stated they will be escelating actions agains the west.
    Afghanistan may be undegoing a coup at this time. The US has also announced they
    will be working towards tkaing the Gaza strip, and possibly making it a US
    territory.
