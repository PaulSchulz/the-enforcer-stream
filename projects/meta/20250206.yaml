    RUSSIAN ARMY IS MADE UP OF ASSES. YOU THOUGHT I WAS TALKING
    ABOUT MULES DIDN'T YA? LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Russian has made a nuclear military alliance with Belarus, allowing Russians
    troops to build up along the Ukrainian and Polish borders, threatening the
    western world with a preemptive attack by Russia, and threatening Kyiv's
    northern flank simultaneously. Russian forces have now officially run out of
    vehicles, as donkeys are now being used and deployed on an army wide scale as
    vehicles are no longer obtainable in most cases. This comes as Russia says they
    are going to be tough on negotiations, which means they'll leave the
    negotiations on the donkey they rode in on. Ukrainian forces have held the lines
    today. Panama has waived all transit fees for US military vessels saving the US
    a whopping 3 million dollars annually, and US operations at the border are in
    the recconaisance phase. it is day 1078 of the war.
