  description: |
    A Russian Oreshnik IRBM was launched at Ukraine today and
    experienced a critical failure, exploding midfight over Russia. This was a
    massive embarrassment coming on the heels of a Massive Ukrainian push in Kursk,
    pushing the Russians back 4 miles in 4 hours, a major offensive victory. Russian
    forces seem to re reeling from the shock of the attacks today while France has
    announced the arrival of the first Mirage 2000s into Ukraine. Iran has launched
    their first drone carrier to much fanfare; its a converted cargo ship. Saudia
    Arabia has bombarded Houthi positions with THermobaric rockets today in an
    attempt to dirupt the presence near their border.
