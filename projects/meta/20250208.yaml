    serious trouble holding the lines. Ukrainian forces were able to conduct
    counterattacks in Toretsk, stopping the grinding Russian advance through the
    city for today, and also engaged Russians in Toretsk. This led to a complete
    cessation of Russian advances on both fronts. The missing Bering flight was
    found, all 10 souls onboard perished in the crash.
