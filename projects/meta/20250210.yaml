    Storm Shadows hit Russian facilities in the Oryol Oblast overnight, causing
    significant damage to the Russian military's abililities while defending the
    Kursk Oblast. Iran has rejected nuclear talks with the US, showing clear signs
    they are working towards nuclear weapons and will not even consider the slowing
    of the progress on these weapons of terror. Ukrainian F-16's were seen for the
    first time conducting air to ground operations near the front lines. Ukrainian
    forces have launched a new counteroffensive south of Pokrovsk attempting to cut
    off and encircle Russian battle groups.
