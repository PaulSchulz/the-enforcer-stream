    Russia has suffered major losses on all fronts, as Russian forces are being
    pushed back by large Ukrainian counterattacks. Russian forces are now on the
    defensive, as Ukrainian drones rain down on Saratov and Engels causing heavy
    destruction to war production and assets. The US has issued an ultimatum to
    Iranian proxies that they are to release all hostages by this Saturday on noon
    or they will face annihilation at the hands of US and Israeli forces. Egypt has
    ended talks with the US, denying entry to any Palestinians that are displaced
    form the strip in the future. Syria has also suspended the removal of Russian
    troops in Tartus, blocking them from leaving as Diplomatic talks between Russian
    and Syria stall. Russian aircraft have violated Polish airspace for over a
    minute today near Gdansk. The EU is preparing a plan to seize all Russian shadow
    fleet tankers to stop Russian oil and gas exports for the remainder of the war.
