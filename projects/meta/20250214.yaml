    Russian forces have been seen surrenduring at Pokrovsk as the Ukrainian
    counterattack has put the Russian forces on the backfoot, and stopped their
    advance for a while. In Gaza, Hamas forces broke the ceasefire today by firing a
    failed rocket at Israel, it landed in the Gaza strip killing one person. The
    United States appears to be shuttling secretaries and diplomats to Munich and
    Msocwo for the upcoming Munich conference, and Ukraine will now be included in
    every step of the process. Russia is also building a Naval Base in Sudan.
