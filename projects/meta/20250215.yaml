    US forces have been deployed to Poland, as Russian diplomats refused to
    arrive for the Munich conference today. The Russian federation has also stated
    that they have not agreed to meet in Saudia Arabia with the US president, and
    appear to be continuing the war. A Russian drone struck and heavily damaged the
    containement structure around the Chernobyl Nuclear Powerplant in a deliberate
    attack overnight. The United states appears to once gain be moving towards
    hostile measures against Russia in support of Ukraine. The US and Israel have
    agreed to conduct hostile action against Iran if they do not stop their nuclear
    aspirations.
