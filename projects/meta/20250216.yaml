    RUSSIA LOSING HEAVILY IN POKROVSK, IRAN MILITARY BUILDUP! Breaking War News
    With The Enforcer 1088
  morse: |
    RUSSIA IS ACTING LIKE THEY ARE STRONG AND NEARLY LOSING THE WHOLE
    POKROVSK BATTLE ON THE SAME DAY. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Russian forces are in an incredibly unstable position in Pokrovsk as
    Ukrainian armed forces continue their counteroffensive in the front, pushing the
    Russian back and nearly collapsing the front lines in the area as of today.
    Russian armed forces are heavily overwhelmed about the perilous front line
    situation. In southern Iran the Iranian armed forces have been seen conducting a
    heavy military buildup in Chanbahar near to the strait of Hormuz possibly
    threatening global trade. US wargames began in the pacific today with the French
    and Japanese in participation. Europe is considering the creation of a new form
    of NATO, and Ukraine has not been invited to the Saudia Arabian conference with
    the Russians even if it is happening.
