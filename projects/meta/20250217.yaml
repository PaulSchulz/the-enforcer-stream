    Britain has made a direct statement today threatening the deplyoment and
    use of British Armed forces in Ukraine given the current diplomatic situation,
    according to a direct statement by the British prime minister. This comes as
    Russian forces are bieng pushed back in Pkrovsk and Kursk, and seem to be losing
    ground and abilities as the war has begun to reach it's terminal phase. Poland
    has opted out of joining the British mission. Ukrainian drones have slammed down
    across the entire Krasnodar and Belgorod Oblast areas, causing considerable
    damage to the Russian war machine.
