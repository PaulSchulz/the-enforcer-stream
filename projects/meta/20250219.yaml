    Russian forces have been pushed back in Toretsk, Pokrovsk, and Kursk as
    Ukrainian forces continue to drive at weakened Russian lines, hoping to throw
    Russian forces into disarray and stop any offensives during the spring of this
    year. This comes as Ukraine destroyed the Refinery at Samara, a major Russian
    refinery along the volga that is hundreds of miles deep inside of
    Russia. Meanwhile the US and Russia conducted talks in Saudia Arabia, and Ukraine
    was not included. Turkey has now stepped in to see about creating a peace deal
    ameanable to Ukraine and Russia without US involvement. Europe's war machine is
    working even harder as a new 6 Billion euro aid package is to be announced.
