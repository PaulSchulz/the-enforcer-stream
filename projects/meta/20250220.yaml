    Ukrainian forces have continued to push Russia back in Pokrovsk and Toretsk,
    while simultaneopusly repulsing Russian attacks at Chasiv Yar, Kursk, Veylka
    Novosilka, and Kupyansk. Russian forces cannot break the Ukrainian army on the
    field, but the Russian government attempts to break the will of the west to
    support Ukraine in the war. Europe has stepped forward to assure that they will
    continue to support Ukraine even if the US backs out. In Moscow a massive fire
    rages through an important building used for the research of inventions of war,
    the fire has not been extinguished and is consuming the institute. Russia has
    demanded that US forces withdraw from all NATO countries east of Germany, it is
    unknown if the US will agree to this demand. The US conducted a test firing of a
    ICBM from Vandenberg, the luanch was a success.
