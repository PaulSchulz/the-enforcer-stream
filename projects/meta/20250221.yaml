    News With The Enforcer

    IT'S A SILLY THING  TO WATCH RUSSIA GET PUSHED BACK AND
    THEN ACT STRONG. LMAO EVEN. LLTLSA!

    Russian forces are still being pushed back in the Pokrovsk and Toretsk
    directions as Ukrainian forces drive forward on a major counterattack that is in
    it's third successful day. Russian forces are unable to stop the Ukrainian
    advance at this time, and appear to be entirely defensive in battlefield
    posture. Meanwhile this comes as the Russians feint a position of strength on
    the diplomatic stage as the US and Russia continue to play out an asinine
    diplomatic action. Meanwhile the Polish are now demanding that frozen Russian
    assets be used to support Ukraine. In Tel Aviv bombs exploded onboard Israeli
    busses as a major attack sprang forward into action. Israel has begun offensive
    operations in the west bank and the Syrian-Lebanon border.
