    Russia has suffered major damage overnight from a massive Ukrainian drone
    attack that targeted and destroyed vital Russian oil storage and refinery
    facilities throughout the western regions of Russia. Russian forces continue to
    face severe battlefield losses as the Ukrainian army continues to repulse heavy
    Russian attacks, and keeps pushing Russians soldiers back in Pokrovsk and
    Toretsk. Currently Zelensky is smoothing out diplomatic tensions between Ukraine
    and the US, and has even offered to step down as preisdent of Ukraine for NATO
    membership. Zelensky also clarified that further US support is continuing for
    now, although no new support packages have been announced.
