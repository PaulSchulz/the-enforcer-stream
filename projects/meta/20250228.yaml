    US HEAVILY SANCTIONS RUSSIA, UKRAINE PUSHED RUSSIA BACK! Breaking War News With The Enforcer 1100
  morse: |
   THINGS ARE NOW TURNING AGAINST THE RUSSIANS, WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE?! LLTLSA!
  description: |
    The United States has made a shocking reversal, extending sanctions onto the
    Russian Federation for the next year, while also stating that President Zelensky
    is "the greatest president of Ukraine." This comes as Zelensky arrived at
    Andrews AFB just hours ago. Russian forces are taking massive beatings along
    most fronts, and are still being pushed back in Toretsk and Pokrovsk. Russia
    seems to be on the back foot considerably. A massive explosion was seen in
    Kursk, and it is believed that it is a ammunition depot explosion.
