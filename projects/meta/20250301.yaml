    A major diplomatic disaster unfolded today in the White House between the
    presidents of Ukraine and the US, as the diplomatic meeting went to verbal blows
    after Zelensky requested security assurances to be a part of the mineral deal
    that was to be signed. Zelensky was then told to leave the White House, and
    after a mainstream TV interview, is now back on his way to London to be a part
    of a eurpean security summit. Moscow was attacked by Ukrainian drones during
    that time, and while damage assessments have not yet been revealed it appears
    that a large number of Ukrainian drones were involved in the attack. Ukrainian
    forces have kept up momentum in Pokrovsk and Toretsk, the Russians becoming
    increasingly more weak as the days pass by. France has called for Europe to
    split from the US and create a seperate sphere of influence.
