    RUSSIA ENCIRCLED IN TORETSK, NORWAY TURNS AWAY US SUBMARINE! Breaking War News W/ The Enforcer 1102

    Russia has been encircled in three major areas of the city of Toretsk,
    Ukrainian forces now seem to be on the verge of driving Russia out of the city
    or completely encircling them. This comes as the Russian Federation has now
    issued an order allowing the government to confiscate personal vehicles for
    military purposes. The fallout of the disastorous Ukrainian-US conference at the
    white house has become evident, as a european led summit will begin tomorrow,
    and the USS Virginia was turned away by Norwegian oilers who refused to refuel
    US naval vessels. US rivet joint aircraft are surveying the Mexican border in
    greater detail, as it appears that the US is considering a possible ground
    invasion of northern Mexico.
