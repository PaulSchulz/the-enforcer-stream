  morse: {}
  description: |
    Russian forces have been completely surrounded in Toretsk, Ukrainian forces
    have now reached the downtown and have access to the major roadways Russian
    forces would need to use to retreat. Massive explosions rocked a large refinery
    in Ufa only hours ago as a mysterious drone or missile came roaring down onto
    the refinery casuing significant damage. Ukrainian armed forces have kept
    pressure high on the Russians, while diplomatic pressures have also been running
    high as well. A European summit was held today, and the european powers made it
    clear they have unwavering support towards Ukraine. The idea of a ceasefire was
    mentioned, but rejected by Zelensky.
