    China threatens war with the United States after heavy sanction regimines
    have been implemented against the People's Republic of China. While the Chinese
    threat was made clear, the United States has also states that they are ready for
    war and will engage China wherever a threat from them may arise. Meanwhile the
    US is funneling large amounts of military support to Israel for upcoming
    operations to destroy or disable remaining Iranian proxy forces in the region,
    and possiblyt to neutralize Iran's nuclear programs. Russian forces are breaking
    under the immense pressures in Toretsk and Pokrovsk as they continue to fall
    back from Ukrainian counterattacks. President Macron of France has openly stated
    that Europe needs to position itself to become it's own sphere of influence
    today in a televised address.
