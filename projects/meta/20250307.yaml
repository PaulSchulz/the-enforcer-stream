    WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT JOLANI BECAUSE TH EWHOLE PLACE IS GOING UP. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Major firefights have broken out across the Syrian coastline as the Syrian
    interim government now devolves into civil war once more. This comes only months
    after the fall of the Asad regime, and the rebels appear to be backed and
    supported by Iran. Currently no statement has been made by the interim
    government, but massive clashes are occuring in Latakia and Tartus at this time.
    Russian forces have continued to be steadily pushed back in Donetsk as Ukrainian
    forces continue their offensives. So far Russian forces are still in a perilous
    position in Toretsk, and are being pished further back from Pokrovsk. The United
    States attempted an ousting of President Zelensky today through his political
    opponents, but they went public with the attempt and denounced it.
