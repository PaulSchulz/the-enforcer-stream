    THE NEWS AND THE WORLD WAS A PRETTY CRAZY PLACE TODAY BUT NOW WE GET TO SEE IT.
    LLTLSA!

    Ukrainian forces have successfully liberated the city of Toretsk from
    Russian forces, taking a large number of prisoners in the process. Ukrainian
    forces have not had such a successful time in Kursk, as a Russian offensive has
    broken through the defensive lines south of Sudzha and has nearly reached the
    Ukrainian border, leading some Ukrainian generals believe that a withdrawal may
    be the best option. North Korea has threatened war with the US and South Korea
    over planned military exercises coming in a few weeks. In response the US will
    be increasing the size of the joint drills. Poland has begun to mobilize their
    entire population, and pursue possible nuclearization due to the threat of US
    withdrawal from NATO. US forces may be redeployed from Germany further into
    Eastern Europe.
