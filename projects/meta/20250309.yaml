    MASSIVE EXPLOSIONS ACROSS RUSSIA, SURPRISE ATTACK IN KURSK FAILS! Breaking
    War News W/ The Enforcer
  morse: |
    RUSSIA ACTING LIKE A BIG BOY AND THEN THEY GET SLAMMED BY DOZENS OF DRONES.
    LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Massive explosions were booming across the whole of Russia overnight as
    Ukrainian droens began to hit a wide number of strategic targets throughout the
    Russian Federation's western regions. It appears that the attack was wildly
    successful, and that there will be damage to the Russian war industry. Russia
    attempted a surprise attack in the Kursk oblast which failed, as they climbed
    out of a pipeline into Sudzha and took heavy losses in the battle. Iran has
    stated they will not back off of their nuclearization, and germany warns that
    Russia is poised to attack europe in the future.
