    The Enforcer 1110
  morse: |
    RUSSIA IS TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION IN kURSK WHILE IT LASTS.
    IT WONT LAST LONG .LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Russia is continuing to lose ground in the Donetsk region on all fronts, as
    Ukrainian forces keep up the pressure in Pokrovsk, Toretsk, and Chasiv Yar.
    Russian forces have been able to advance, taking several villages in the Kursk
    Oblast, which it appears that this may be due to a lack of intelligence provided
    by the US. The US has announced that Ukraine signing the mineral deal may not
    resume military support for Ukraine. Iran has stated that they are ready for war
    with the US and are racing to produce a usable nuclear weapon. The US and South
    Korea has begin military exercises today, which North Korea has warned that
    there would be dire consequences to.
