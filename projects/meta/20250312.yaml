    -A massive drone attack has hammered Moscow, as nearly 450 Ukrainian drones came raining down across the city. Russia has stated that they may launch nuclear capable Oreshnik missiles as retaliation. The United States, in a shocking reversal, has now resumed Ukrainian military and intelligence support after talks concluded in Saudia Arabia today. Ukraine has also agreed to presenting a 30 day ceasefire to the Russian Federation, although the Russians have not replied to the ceasefire arrangment yet. North Korea has threatened nuclear war over South Korea-US wargames which are currently being conducted.
