    With The Enforcer 1114
  morse: |
    RUSSIANS HAVE BEEN PUT INTO THE CORNEWR NOW WITH THEIR ANSWER TO THE
    CEASEFIRE. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Russia has been slammed by a new wave of US sanctions after the Russian
    Federation has made it clear they are not willing to accept a ceasefire without
    all of their tersm being met before hand; meaning they do not want to discuss
    terms but only have theirs accepted unconditionally. Belraus has threatened NATO
    with war during a joint press press conference with Putin today, where it is
    clear that the Russians and Belarus are still openly hostile against the west
    and the US. Ukrainian forces have made frontline gains today at Pokrovsk and
    Toretsk, with Russian forces still showing that they have reached their limit of
    fighting.
