    DELICACY, LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Massive explosions have rocked Russia as Ukrainian drones, and for the first
    time missiles, rained down across Russia. A refinery was severely hit by
    missiles and turned into an acutal fireball which is still raging into the day.
    Ukrainian forces have pushed the Russians back in Pokrovsk, and are continuing
    to fight in Toretsk. Russian negotiatiors are currently stalling in the
    negotiation process, and do not appear to be acting in good faith.
