    Massive US airstrikes have been conducted against the Yemeni Houthis for
    the past 48 hours, with massive damage being inflicted on Houthi forces near
    Major strongholds. Houthi forces have returned fire, some missiles targeted the
    USS Harry S. Truman, all missiles were intercpeted by the Carrier Strike Group.
    US leadership has stated that the strikes will go on until Houthi aggression
    against global shipping in the Red Sea stops. In Russia, a massive drone strike
    has been launched by Ukraine again, hitting airbases, refineries, and other
    vital targets. Hezbollah attacked the Syrian interim government forces near the
    Lebanese border today, starting a major conflict between Hezbollah and the
    Syrian Interim Government. Brtiain and France are now creating their own
    security guarantee pact for Ukraine, pledging that they can push this forward
    outside of a US led peace agreement. A Chinese J-15 crashed during a training
    exercise, and the Japanese are deploying missiles to the Ktushu islands to deter
    aggressive chinese actions.
