    The Iranian-backed Houthis have officially declared a state of war against
    the United States of America, as the multi-day long air campaign continues to
    rain down hellfire over Houthi controlled Yemen. Iran has openly stated that
    they back and support all proxy forces including the Houthis. The President of
    the United States has stated that any hostile actions by proxy forces will be
    viewed as direct hostile action from Iran, and will be responded to as such.
    Ukraine has opened a new offensive in Belgorod, with Ukrainian armed forces
    streaming across the border. It is unclear as to the progress of this invasion,
    but it appears there is a foothold at minimum. Diplomatic talks between the US
    and Russia continue to stall, with the Russians agreeing to a 30 day energy
    infrastrucutre ceasefire, and then immediatly breaking the ceasefire only hours
    later by striking the Slovyansk power plant.
