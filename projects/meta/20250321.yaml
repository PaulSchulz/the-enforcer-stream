    Engels Airbase has been levelled in a massive explosion caused by a Ukrainian
    attack. The massive shockwave flattened the airbase and surrounding areas of the
    city. Ukrainian forces have confirmed to have made a foothold in Belgorod and
    are making ground. The Chinese army seems to be moving into open opposition of
    Xi Jinping, as propaganda published by the PLA is now beginning to critisize his
    leadership. Poland is ordering 1 million landmines to create extensive
    minefields around their eastern borders. New US-Russian talks on the war will
    begin in Ritadh once more, the progress may be nonexistant. The US has told
    Israel it will bomb the Houthis on behalf of both of them.
