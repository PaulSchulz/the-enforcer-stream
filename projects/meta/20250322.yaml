    Russian forces have been pushed back in Belgorod as Ukrainian armed forces
    continue to make themselves a larger foothold in the region, and increase the
    intensity of their attacks. A massive explosion was seen in Sudzha as a vital
    pipeline was hit with an explosion and began to vent burning gas into the
    surrounding areas. Russia's critical infastructure continues to be hit heavily
    by Ukrainian drones, as videos from Southern Russia show. Iran suffered a
    moderate earthquake near to a nuclear development fecility today, while US
    airstrikes bombard the Houthis and Israel declares the death of the Hamas
    intelligence leader. The UK is investigating the substation explosion which
    closed Heathrow Airport as a likely act of sabotage.
