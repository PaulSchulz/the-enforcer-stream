    their command and fighting abilities, the US is continuing to ramp up their
    actions against Houthi forces until an official cessation of hostilities is
    announced by Houthi forces. The US is pressuring Iran further and demanding for
    public denuclearization. Iran has threatened that they will destroy the US and
    the EU if there is any armed response against them. Meanwhile Lithuania is now
    also laying landmines on their border as fears of a Russian invasion in the fall
    loom heavy over the country.
