    LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Russian forces have nearly been encircled in Toretsk as Ukrainian forces
    sweeped Russian forces clean off the southern flank of the battlefield. The
    remaining Russians in the city appear to have their rear lines exposed to attack
    and are in a precarious position. US forces are now preparing for the attack on
    Iran as 7 B-2 stealth bombers are now based at Diego Garcia, and more US forces
    are moving to the area while Iran continues to posture in a hostile manner
    against the US and Israel. Ceasefire talks ended in an inclonclusive resolution.
