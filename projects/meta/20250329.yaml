    RUSSIAN FORCES OBLITERATED ON ALL FRONTS, PEACE TALKS COLLAPSE! Breaking War
    News W/ The Enforcer
  morse: |
    RUSSIA IS GOING TO HAVE TO GET ONBOARD WITH THE IDEA THEY SUCK BEFORE WE
    TO THEM AGAIN. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Russian forces have taken wildly high losses on all fronts, with nearly
    2,000 Russians being reported as casualties over a 24 hour period. Russian armed
    forces are in precarious positions still in Pokrovsk and Toretsk, and it appears
    that Ukrainian counteroffensives have stabilized the situation across the
    eastern front according to Zelensky. Peace talks have collapsed today as Russia
    now demand that they will nto continue any further talks unless if Zelensky and
    his government is removed in Ukraine, a concept the US openly refused today. The
    US has killed several top officials in airstrikes in Yemen, and are moving the
    USS Carl Vinson into the area after it's departure from Guam.
