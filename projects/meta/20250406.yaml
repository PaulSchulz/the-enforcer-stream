    VITAL RUSSIAN FACILITY DESTROYED, MASSIVE US DEPLOYMENT NEAR IRAN! Breaking
    War News W/ The Enforcer
  morse: |
    RUSSIA IS LOSING IT'S FIBER AND OPTICS. SOUNDS LIKE THEY ARE GOING
    GERIATRIC. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    A Vital Russian facility has been destroyed only hours ago, which was the
    only facility in the entire Russian Federation capable of producing fiber optic
    wires and cables, resulting in serious loss of Russia's FPV drone abilities.
    Russian forces have continued to be pushed back in Pokrovsk and Toretsk, while
    Ukrainian forces continue to hold the line on all fronts and are continuing
    attmepted offensives in Belgorod. Nearly 300,000 US soldiers have been deployed
    into the middle east at bases surrounding Iran, as possible armed action is now
    a near certainty as the Iranians have declared they will not conduct any
    denuclearization.
