    with explosions also sounding in Taganrog, anf many other cities in Russia.
    Russian forces are being gradually pushed back in Belgorod and Pokrovsk,
    Ukrainian forces cautiously eliminate Russian forces and advance onto their

    China for 90 days, leading the stock market to skyrocket in value.
