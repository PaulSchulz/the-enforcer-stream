    RUSSIA HAS A CASUAL FIRE ON A NUCLEAR STORAGE SITE AND THERE I5N'T A MENTION
    OF IT? LLTLSA!
  description: |
    A Russian nuclear weapons storage facility at Engels airbase has been
    reported to be on fire, as a large column of smoke rises from in and around the
    facility. It is unknown as to the cause of the fire, but the risk of nuclear
    warheads exploding appears minimal at the time. China arrested a top general of
    the Central Military Committee today as a part of their continued purge of the
    PLA of Xi dissenters. The US has now extended sanctions onto Russia for another
    year as the negotiations have clearly stalled. The US and Iran have begun talks
    about Iranian nuclearization.
