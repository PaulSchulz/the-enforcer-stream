    THEN THE PRICE OF THE OIL IS DROPPING THE PUTIN IS BOUNCING HIS HEAD OFF THE
    DESK. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    The Russian economy is falling apart as the massive drop in the price of
    crude oil is projected to lose the Russian economy 1 trillion rubles worth of
    income, and force Russia into an economic collapse that could be gravely severe
    within less than a year. MEanwhile Ukraine continues to take ground in Toretsk
    and Pokrovsk as the Russian army finds it difficult to hold defensive positions
    in these fronts due to heavy losses and supply line strains. No word has come
    out about US-Iranian talks in Oman, and China is demanding the US drop all
    tarriffs as they suspend the sell of rare earths to the US.
