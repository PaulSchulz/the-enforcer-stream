    MASSIVE EXPLOSIONS IN RUSSIA, MIDDLE EAST ON BRINK OF WAR! Breaking War
    News W/ The Enforcer 1147
  morse: |



  description: |
    Russia was hit with massive drone attacks overnight as Ukrainian forces
    attempted to destroy more Russian war industries and military equipment, with
    nearly 30 drones hitting the city of Kursk alone. Russia has also been losing
    ground in the Velyka Novosilka direction, as Ukrainian counterattacks being
    driving the Russian forces further south, and also ensure that the Russian army
    is kept on the backfoot on most fronts currently. The middle east is at the
    brink of wear, with US negotiations continuing aimlessly, with no real plan in
    sight. The US continues to move more forces and equipment into the region under
    the idea that eventually the talks will fall apart.
