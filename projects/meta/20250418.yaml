    support to the Russian Federation. Meanwhile the Ukrainians have conducted a
    massive attack against the Russians in Luhansk in a lightning 30 hour offensive,
    driving the Russians back towards Svatove, and putting the Russians in a bad
    position on the eastern front. Israel is preparing to conduct an attack on Iran
