    In Krasnodar a state of emergency has been declared as an entire Russian
    unit has mutinied against the Russian government and is running havoc through
    the streets. Currently authorities are attempting to arrest the mutiniers, as
    chaos still reigtns in Krasnodar's streets. Meanwhile China is now stating that
    they will be sending troops to Ukraine to gain experience for the inevitable
    invasion of Taiwan. US- Russian talks appear to be collpapsing as the Secretary
    of State states that if there is not a resolution in the coming days then they
    will move accordingly. Russian forces have taken incredibly high losses across
    the whole front as Ukrainian forces drove their offensives forward, and stopped
    Russian offensives entirely.
