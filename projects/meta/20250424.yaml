  description: |
    One of the largest ammo depots in Russia just outside of Moscow exploded
    after a Ukrainian attack hit the facility. the explosion was the largest of the
    war, scattering hundreds of Tons of explosives through the air, and vaporizing
    several hundred more tons. Russia is continuing to fight in Ukraine as it seeks
    to win the war at all costs, Ukraine is fighting multiple counteroffensives and
    has been able to make modest gains in Pokrovsk and Sumy, as well as stop the
    Russians in Toretsk and Chasiv Yar. India appears to be preparing for a conflict
    with Pakistan after a proxy attack, allegedly backed by Pakistan, killed dozens
    inside of the Kashmir region of the country. Meanwhile the United States is
    attempting to manage the major trade war with China, stating it could take 2-3
    years of negotiations to fix the current trade issues. Meanwhile the US appears
    to have attempted to appease Putin in the peace process, whihc the Ukrainians
    have refused the notion of attempting, bringing the president's ire back on the
    Ukrainian state.
