    INDIA AND PAKISTAN GOING TO WAR... WASN'T OFF THE TABLE, BUT THIS QUICKLY?
    LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Indian armed forces have engaged Pakistani forces inside of the Leepa
    valley, as both sides make aggressive military moves clearly showing that war is
    an inevitable certainty in the region. Indian officials have closed off all
    tributaries to the Indus River, with Pakistan stating this is grounds for war
    (Pakistan relies on the water sources starting in India for it's supplies of
    water). Both countries are nuclear armedm meaning this will be the first direct
    armed conflict between two nuclear armed countries in history. MEanwhile Russian
    forces have been routed across multiple fronts after a disasterous attempt at
    multiple offensives across the frontline. Ukrainian rmed forces continue to hold
    their ground, and are furthering their offensives in Donestk and Luhansk.
