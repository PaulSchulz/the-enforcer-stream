    IF YOU"RE GOING TO BE WATCHING THE NEWS TODAY, STRAP IN BECAUSE IT'S GOTTEN
    ABSOLUTELY CRAZY! LLTLSA!
  description: |
    A top Russian general was killed inside of Moscow today after a car bomb
    detonated along his morning walkt to work, the General was killed instantly, and
    was one of the top Generals involved in the Russian Ministry of Defense, and his
    death will be a severe loss to the Russian war effort. The Armies of Pakistan
    are rapidly deploying across the entire border with India, as India has now made
    it clear that they will be diverting water from the Indus river permanantly, and
    are already diverting the flow of water elsewhere to deny Pakistan any access to
    fresh water. This action is the most severe action taken to date, and is now
    setting the scene for the already brewing war between the two nuclear armed
    nations. Ukrainian forces have stopped a Russian counterattack in Toretsk today
    as they continue to hold their positons and make advances wherever possible.
