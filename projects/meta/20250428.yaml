  description: |
    North Korea has officially declared war on the state of Ukraine and has
    stated they will be sending a large number of forces into Russia to join in
    fighting against the Ukrainian armed forces. Ukrainian forces are holding the
    Russians back on most fronts, and are continuing to take ground in the Toretsk
    battlefield. India will attack Pakistan in full force moving the border war into
    total war in a matter of days as both sides rapidly mobilize, with heavy
    firefights already occuring along the border. Iran has suffered heavy damage at
    Bandar Abbas, and the United States appears ready to return to an unfriendly
    stance on the diplomatic front with the Russian Federation.
