    War News W/ The Enforcer
  morse: |
    NOW RUSSIA IS GOING TO BE SWEATING NOW TALKS ARE PREMATURE. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Massive explosions have rocked Crimea as Ukrainian drones have hit their
    marks, scoring devestating hits against the Russian armed forces radar
    facilities and other locations critical to the war effort. The US has taken a
    complete 180 nearly overnight against Russia, now stating that if Russia doesn't
    make a deal then they will supply Ukraine with more weapons than ever before. A
    50 Million dollar package has just been approved in the congress to support
    Ukraine, which may be followed by far larger bills in the future. Meanwhile
    India and Pakistan have engaged in a small air skirmish today while the
    subcontinent sits on pins and needles waiting for the war to start. Israle has
    conducted an airstrike near Damascus as a warning to Kolani to stop further
    agression against the Druze rebels.
