  description: |
    Ukraine attacked Russia with a massive drone attack overnight, hitting a
    secret Russian facility used to communicate with Russian satellites in Orbit, a
    crucial part of the Russian global command structure. Explosions also rocked the
    cities of Kursk, Rostov on Don, Kerch, and others. Ukrainian armed forces have
    continued their offensives in Toretsk and Pokrovsk, and the Russians have been
    held back on all other fronts. The US has announced hundreds of millions in
    support to Ukraine o sustain their F-16 fleet. Paksitan is still saying that an
    attack from India is "imminent" leading some to wonder when the attack will
    occur. China has now put their full support behind Pakistan. Israeli and Turkish
    aircraft had a show down over Damascus as the heavy battles between the Druze
    and Jolani continue on the lands below.
