    Russia has been crippled in a massive Ukrainian drone attack, hitting Crimea
    and Novorossiysk significantly overnight. A Russian SU-30SM was shot down for
    the first time today an unmanned drone operated as a part of the attack. A major
    explosion rocked Tehran as a major powerplant in the western area of the city
    caight fire and burned heavily. so far information is cluttered surrounding the
    details of the explosion and fire, but it appears the plant may have suffered
    decent amounts of damage as a result. the US has unveiled a new AI operated
    drone today, and Putin will attend the May 9th Parade via zoom.
