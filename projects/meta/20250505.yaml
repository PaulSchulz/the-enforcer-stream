    24 hours as Ukrainian froces continue to keep up a high tempo of attacks and
    also continue to hold the Russians back. In Israel a Houthi missile struck the
    Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv, with Israel now stating military action is
    inevitable against the Houthis and Iran as a direct repsonse. Iran also suffered
