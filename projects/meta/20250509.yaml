  description: |
    Massive strikes have been conducted by India and Pakistan over the past 24
    hours, hitting major cities and military targets through the night. Indian naval
    forces have now issued NOTAMS near to Pakistani waters for "Live fire exercises"
    which may result in direct action by the Indian navy on Pakistan. Both sides
    have signalled full interest in escalating the conflict form here. Ukrainian
    forces have captured the city of Tetkino, a small city several miles in Russia
    inside of the Kursk Oblast. Russian forces have been unable to uproot or drive
    the Ukrainian forces out, showing that they will have to divert a larger number
    of forces into the area. US policy is rapidly shifting on Russia, as the US is
    becoming far more friendly with Ukraine and much more hostile against Russia.
