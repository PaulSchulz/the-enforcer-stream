    Russia has announced in a shocking development that they will enter peace
    talks with Ukraine in Ankara on the 15th of May, under the threat that they
    Ukraine will recieve a far larger number of weapons than they ever have before.
    Russian forces are still taking heavy losses on the ground as Russian forces
    continued attacks on Pokrovsk over the past 48 hours, in violation of a
    unilateral ceasefiure that was impsoed by Russia for the May 9th Victory Day
    Parade. Ukrainian forces have continued to conduct their offensives in Belgorod
    and Tetkino, holding small pockets of ground and diverting Russian forces away
    from the Ukrainian front. India and Pakistan entered into a short lived
    ceasefire which lasted 4 hours which was brokered by the United States. The
    ceasefire ended after 4 hours as Pakistani drones began to bombard the city of
    Jammu, and fighting still continues over the LOC. This did not stop Pakistan
    from claiming victory in the conflict, which at this moment is still ongoing.
