    Russian forces have been pushed back out of the city center in Chasiv Yar
    as Ukrainian forces continue to vlaiantly hold onto the hilltop city, stopping
    the Russians from going down the sloped and into Konstyantynivka only several
    miles west. Ukrainian forces have also held off the Russians in Pokrovsk,
    although Ukraine warns Russia is now amassing more forces for another offensive.
    Meanwhile Putin has announced he will not be going to Ankara, and instead will
    send Lavrov as chief negotiator. Israel has announced that a new ground
    offensive in Gaza will be imminent, and the US has continued to show disdain for
    the action. The US has also lifted all sanctions on the HTS held Syria, as
    another US drone is shot down over Houthi skies. India and Paksitan continue to
    fire at each other as diplomats are expelled, and Pakistan makes announcements
    to stock up on vital perishables.
