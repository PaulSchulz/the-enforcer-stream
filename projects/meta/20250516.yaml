    Ukrainian forces have continued their incursions into the Kursk and Belgorod
    regions, driving further in and inflicting heavy losses on the Russian defending
    forces. Heavy attacks destroyed an entire motorized column in Belgorod along
    with a significant relay tower used by the Russian army. Meanwhile Peace talks
    in Istanbul have collpased before they began, with Zelensky leaving before the
    talks began, and the US has made it clear their hopes are low. In the meantime
    the Russians demand the same terms they made in 2022, which is capitulation of
    the Ukrainian state. In Israel, ground forces are preparing for another ground
    incursion into the region as the US voices concerns over the humanitarian
    situation inside of Gaza. Pakistan has recieved the J-35 aircraft from China far
    earlier than anticipated, as seen in footage today. Ukrainian forces continue
    holding the line on all Ukrainian fronts.
