    morse: |
    ISRAEL IS ABOUT TO DO WHAT THEY WANT AND SYRIA IS ABOUT TO FALL APART OF COURSE. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Israel has announced that they are moving ahead with targeting and striking
    Iranian nuclear development and research sites, as the US also vows to provide
    intelligence to strike and destroy the sites more efficiently. Iran has seized a
    Panamanian flagged vessel near to their coast as the tensions escalate, taking
    the crew as hostages. The Syrian government is now expected to collapse within
    weeks according to US intelligence, as the rebel groups grow in strength and
    size, and have attacked the Russian airbase near to Latakia. Ukrainian forces
    have held their frontlines today, as Russian forces now build up troops along
    the Finnish Norwegian borders. Ukrainian forces have slowed Russian advances in
    most fronts, and stopped them in Chasiv Yar, Toretsk, and Pokrovsk.
