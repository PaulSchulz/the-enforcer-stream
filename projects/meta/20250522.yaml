    A North Korean warship has sank during an event attended by Kim Jung Un
    unveiling a new cutting edge warship in the Korean People's Navy. The vessel
    completely capsized with Kim Jung Un stating that is was "a crime of the highest
    order," and has stated those responsible will be punished. Massive drone attacks
    have slammed Moscow over the course of the day as Ukrainian drone attacks have
    left a path of destruction all the way from the Ukrainian border to Moscow
    itself, hitting vital factories and completely shutting down Moscow city
    airspace for over a dozen hours. Ukrainian forces keep driving forward
    offensives in Belgorod and Kursk as they conduct defensive actions along the
    main Ukrainian front. China has also warned the US that they will start a space
    based arms racve if they move forward with the Golden Dome project.
