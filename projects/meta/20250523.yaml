    Putin has ordered the Russian army to be deployed throughout the Moscow
    area due to a national emergency brought about by Hundreds of Ukrainian drones
    raining down hellfire onto military and critical infrastructure around the
    capital city. Simultaneously a new Russian offensive was announced where Putin
    plans to create a "Sanitary Zone" along the entirety of the Ukrainian Kursk,
    Sumy, and Chernihiv Oblasts. It appears to be a Russian effort to clearly show
    they do not want the war to end. Satellite footage has uncovered the veiled
    wreck of the North Korean destroyer that went down at Chongjin yesterday,
    proving the loss of North Korea's premiere warship. Iran has also stated that
    any attacks against them by Israel will be considered an attack by the US.
