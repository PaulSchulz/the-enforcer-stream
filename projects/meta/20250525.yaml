    Only minutes ago over a dozen Russian government aircraft have taken off
    form Moscow's airports, flying to every corner of the Russian Federation filled
    with government personnel. Moscow has been under heavy attack by Ukrainian
    drones for hours today, as Russia has also returned drone and missile fire
    towards Kyiv. Air defense was able to shoot down a large number of incoming
    targets but many still made it through hitting the city. Russia has seen major
    attacks throughout the entire country that has caused serious damage. Iran is
    now on high alert for any incoming attacks while battles rage on the front.
