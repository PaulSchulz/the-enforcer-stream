    LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Massive drone attacks have been waged by both sides over the past 24 hours,
    with Ukrainian drones striking throughout all of western Russia in the latest
    drone attacks. Russia has now begin to use naval vessels of the Russian navy to
    escort the shadow tankers in and out of Russian ports, making it more difficult
    to stop them from violating western sanctions. Russia has also launched massive
    attacks on Ukraine, with hundreds of drones being launched over the course of
    the night into Ukraine, and reports indicate that Russian drone production,
    unlike everything else in Russia, is actually increasing monthly. Ukrainian
    armed forces continued to hold their lines today and also attempted to drive the
    Russians back in Kharkiv. North Korea is now attempting to right the ship that
    sank in Chongjin.
