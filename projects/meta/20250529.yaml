  description: |
    A major data leak containing 2 million documents about Russia's most
    secretive ICBM silos and nuclear facilities has just emerged, making it the
    largest Security failure in Russian state history. Documents outlining the plans
    for the facility, weak points, alarm systems, and even the past times of the
    soldiers were published accidentaly by private contractors working on the
    facilities. Meanwhile the Avangard ICBM missile facotry in St. Petersburg,
    responsible for producing Russia's hypersonic ICBMs has caught on fire and the
    strucutre is burning to the ground along with the unfinished avangards inside.
    More Russian governmental aircraft are leaving the area of Moscow and travelling
    to the Urals for unknown reasons, possibly carrying government officials once
    more. US intelligence believes China may invade the outlying islands of Taiwan
    in the near future, as Israel bombards the Houthis again.
