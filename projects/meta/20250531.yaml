    Israel is now prepared to conduct a strike on Iran, and will be doing so in
    a couple of days according to intelligence that has surface on Israels ambitions
    in the region. Meanwhile Iran has now issued NOTAMS across the western region of
    their country, in possible preparation for first strikes on Israel or air
    defense operations. Russian forces have taken heavy losses in Pokrovsk as they
    continue to attempt, with no success, to inch closer towards the city. Russian
    forces are making progress in Sumy where Ukrainian forces are much smaller in
    size; this offensive may have the potential of becoming a major campaign by both
    sides. Russia has been bombarded inside the country once more, with Ukrainian
    droens and bombs hitting Targets in Kursk and Tula.
