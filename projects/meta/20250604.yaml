    HOW BAD OF A WEEK CAN THE RUSSINS HAVE? I MEAN, CAN IT GET WORSE FROM HERE?

    The Kerch bridge has suffered serious damage to the supporting columns near
    the Railroad bridge after a Ukrainian bomb around 1100KG large exploded directly
    on the column. This came as a massive shock to many, as the Kerch Bridge has had
    it's defenses built up extremely over the past year. The US has issued the
    Iranians an ultimatum to stop all enrichment of uranium, apparently stopping
    talks. Meanwhile the commander of the Russian airforce died today after falling
    out a window; they said he was on his way to attend slip and fall school.
    Russian forces are running out of resources to such an extreme degree that they
    are now using more and more North Korean equipment on the front lines.
