    TUPOLEV HACKED IN RUSSIA, PUTIN STOPS ALL PEACE TALKS! Breaking War News

    IN THE WORDS OF JUNIOR SOPRANO PUTIN NEVER HAD THE KINGS OF A VARSITY
    ATHLETE. LLTLSA!

    Hours ago the Ukrainian SBU has announced that they have hacked into the
    Tupolev Aviation Company's computer systems, the very same company responsible
    for producing the aircraft destroyed during Operation Spiderweb several days
    ago. Putin has announced that Russia will no longer even consider peace talks
    with Ukraine, stating that Ukraine is a "terrorist" state for conducting attacks
    on military targets, and not civilian targets like the Russians. Ukrainian
    forces have been able to hold the front lines today once more, inflicting heavy
    casualties on Russian forces. Shoigu has arrived in North Korea to attend a
    meeting with Kim Jung Un to request more military aid for Russia. A large
    weapons cache was found inside of a small village in Poland, the reason for the
    weapons being there is unknown. The US is now moving assets into the middle east
    as prospects of a peaceful resolution to Iranian nuclearization become unlikely.
