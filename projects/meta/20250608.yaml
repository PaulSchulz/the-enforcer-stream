    Russia has been slammed with massive Ukrainian attacks that have destroyed
    Russian oil refining abilities, and also hit and damaged a critical chemical
    production facility in the Tula Oblast. Ukrainian forces have held the
    frontlines and pushed the Russians back at Pokrovsk, inflicting heavy casualties
    on Russian forces. In Moscow a major fire is burning near to a military
