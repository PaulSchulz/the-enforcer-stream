    RUSSIA IS ACTING OUT WITH THEIR "MASSIVE STRIKES" WHICH ARE JUST DRONES... YEP,
    THA IT. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    2 Russian aircraft were destroyed in a Ukrainian drone attack in Russia,
    with an SU-34 and a MiG-31K both taking direct hits and burning to the ground in
    Nizhny Novgorod. Russia has also been attacked in Kazan and Cheboksary again,
    hitting critical infrastructure and once again causing damage to Russia's war
    effort. China, for the first time in history has conducted a naval exercise in
    the western pacific, putting Guam under possible threat of first strike by the
    Communist Chinese. Iran has rejected the US nuclear deal and counteroffered that
    Israel should denuclearize in an official capacity. The United States has
    decided that this is ground for further talks, although time has nearly run out.
    Israel has conducted more strikes on the Houthis as well. In Ukraine the armed
    forces continue to hit Russian forces and hold the line.
