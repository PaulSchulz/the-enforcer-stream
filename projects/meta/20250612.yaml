    Israel is ready and prepered to strike at Iranian nuclear sites that are on
    the verge of creating a nuclear weapon. Iran has stated that they will be
    attacking both Israel and the US if the Israelis move forward with the
    inevitable strike. US embassies and staff are being evacuated as military bases
    are being put on high alert. The US is still tryin to push forward with the 6th
    rounds of talks in Oman amidst the chaos, although these talks will most likely
    never happen. Ukrainian forces have heavily attacked Russian gunpowder factories
