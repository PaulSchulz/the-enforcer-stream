    Iran has just fired hundreds of ballistic missiles towards the State of
    Israel, we are covering the ongoing situation live as it develops. Iranian
    government officials are now fleeing Iran en-masse as Israeli airstrikes kill
    more top government officials, and continue to destroy the very military and
    economic machines that have kept the Islamic regime in power for decades.
    Israeli air forces have claimed air superiority over the Iranian capital of
    Tehran, with Israeli drones now circling the city, finding and marking Iranian
    air defenses for destruction. Israeli airstrikes are currently hitting Bandar
    Abbas in an attempt to destroy the Iranian Navy outright. Key nuclear facilities
    have been destroyed, and Government officials attempting to keep on the move
    have also been targeted and destroyed while on the road. Satellite imagery is
    now coming out showing the complete destruction of many air defense and air
    force bases throughout Iran.
