    The President of the United States has ordered an evacuation of all citizens
    from Tehran as he has departed the G7 summit early and is flying back with all
    possible speed to Washington, as it has been made clear that the US will be
    joining in the strikes against Iran possibly in hours or days, as the US has
    made it clear the Iranians will not possess or use any nuclear weaponry
    according to the US and Israeli governments. Massive explosions are rocking all
    Iranian cities as they are still under massive airstrikes by the Israeli air
    force which is continuing to bomb and destroy top officials and key military
    targets.
