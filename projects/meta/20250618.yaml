    Israel is currently conducting massive airstrikes acorss the whole of
    Tehran. Multiple explosions can be heard and seen through large areas of the
    city. Iranian air defense does not appear to be repsonding to the ongoing
    attacks in a successful way. hours ago the Islamic Republic of Iran has fired
    missiles towards the state of Israel in several volleys, targeting the major
    cities of Haifa and Tel Aviv in the strikes. Israeli air defense is ready to
    inctercept the incoming missiels, and was able to intercept all missiles fired
    by Iran in the prior hours. Key military bases throughout Iran have been
    tagreted and destroyed today, With Israel continuing to slowly break down the
    Iranian military. The US appears poised to join the conflcit, although no
    official action or statements have been made confirming that yet. We are
    covering these events as they develop live.
