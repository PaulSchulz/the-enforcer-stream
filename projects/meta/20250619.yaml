    Iranian air forces have taken more devestating blows over the past 24 hours
    as Israeli attacks have targeted and destoryed some of the few air tankers of
    the Iranian air force in Mashhad, and attack helicopters of the Iranian army in
    Kermanshah. Israel has also targeted and destroyed the Iranian central police HQ
    in Tehran, causing command difficulties for internal security forces. The US and
    UK have set sail all vessels from Bahrain, which are breaking out of the Persian
    Gulf at this time. Iran has fired more missiles as Israel, but it appears that
    dew have made it through. The US is on the brink of war, and while orders for
    war have been given, the final decision has not yet been made. Ukrainian forces
    are still fighting and holding the cities of Toretsk and Pokrovsk as Russian
    forces continue their offensives. Lately a larger number of ballistic missiles
    have been hitting the city of Kyiv, with cluster munitions now seeing use on the
    populated city for the first time; a war crime in itself. Russian forces have
    continued to push through the Donetsk fields far south of Pokrovsk, but all
    other Russian offensives have stalled or are taking heavy losses.
