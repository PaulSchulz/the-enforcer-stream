    RUSSIA AND IRAN ARE CLEARLY ENEMIES OF THE REPUBLIC AND THE WESTERN WORLD.ON TO
    VICTORY! LLTLSA!

    The United States has now issued it's final ultimatum to the Islamic
    Republic of Iran, demanding a dismantling of all nuclear programs and technology
    in their country along with a complete halt on missile development. The Iranians
    already refused both ultimatums earlier in the day before the Ultimatum was even
    made officially. US forces are flooding into the middle east in a heavy stream
    now as Israeli bombardments target and destroy Iranian air defenses and military
    sites throughout the day. After last night's airstrikes in the LAvizan
    neighbrohood which got close to killing the Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khameini,
    he is now going radio silent in hopes it will make it more difficult for Israel
    or the US to target and kill him in the future. Meanwhile in Ukraine the
    Ukrainian armed forces continue to defend the cities of Pokrovsk and Toretsk
    from ongoing Russian offensives. Today, Putin once again began reasserting the
    claim that all of Ukraine will become a part of the Russian Federation, and even
    stated that "Wherever a Russian soldier has set foot is our land," making it
    clear that his ambitions do remain in control of all of eastern europe.
