    IRAN AND RUSSIA HAS BEEN TRYING TO GET OUT OF A RUT BBY LOSING SOME WARS,
    ODD FLEX. LLTLSA
  description: |  
    Iran and Israel have continued to conduct heavy strikes against each other
    after the ceasefire was attempted to be put in place. So far Israel and Iran
    have both vowed to continue strikes against each other much to the anger of the
    President of The United States. Iranian drones were intercepted only a short
    while ago in Northern Israel, and it is believed that more Israeli airstrikes
    may occur soon. Ukraine has slammed the Russian war industries in the city of
    Taganrog, hitting a refinery and drone factory. Meanwhile Ukrainian forces are
    pushing the Russians back towards the Sumy borde,r liberating two villages
    today. Eastern European countries are now mining the border as statements appear
    to be made quite clearly in the NATO summit today; a Russian invasion of Eastern
    Europe is becoming more likely.
