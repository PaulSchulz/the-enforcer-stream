    Russian forces are continuing to be pushed back in the Sumy region of
    Ukraine, after the Russian offensive began with 50,000 troops it was quickly
    bogged down and subsequent counterattacks by Ukrainian armed forces have retaken
    4 villages on the front. Meanwhile Russia lost 4 SU-34 bombers after a
    successful Ukrainian attack on Marinovak airbase. Russia is quickly attempting
    to build aircraft hangars and shelters to protect the rest of their air force.
    Iran has been seen clearly working on rebuilding their nuclear facilities at
    Isfahan and Fordo, as the US is now considering the possiblity of further
    strikes against the Iranian nuclear sites and possibly expanding operaitons into
    a wider scope.
