    Russian airbase in Crimea has been destroyed along with 3 helicopters
    including a rare Mi-28; one of the most rare helicopters in the Russian army.
    This comes as Israel has announced that they are working towards more airstrikes
    against Iran, and the US has made it clear if Iran tries to enrich more uranium
    then they will be bombed further by US forces. Russian federation forces have
    been getting overrun in failed battles today, and a large amount have been taken
    prisoner in Donetsk. A US surveillance vessel is currently 100 miles off the
    Chinese coast near to Beijing gathering vital intelligence and signal data.
