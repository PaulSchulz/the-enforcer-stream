  description: |
    Ukraine has hit and destoryed one of the largest missile factories in Russia
    900 miles inside the Russian Federation. This attack is one of the longest range
    attacks donducted by either side in the war, and has resulted in a crippling
    loss for the Russian rocket forces. Explosions have rocked Tehran in Iran twice
    today, with it being a mystery as to who caused the explosions, although one of
    them was directly on or close to a military base in the southeast of the city.
    Ukrainian forces have also held the line and hit other major Russian force
    basing and supply lines behind in Zaporizhzhia.
