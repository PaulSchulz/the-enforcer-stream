    A Ukrainian attack hit and destroyed a Russian ammo depot east of the city
    of Donetsk. The explosion has leveled a large area and the entire ammo depot was
    destroyed in the blast. Ukrainian armed forces have continued a dogged defense
    of the cities of Pokrovsk and Toretsk, holding the lines and inflicting heavy
    casualties. A Russian FSB general and the Admiral of the Black Sea Fleet were
    both killed in targeted Ukrainian strikes today. In Bushehr Iran near to the
    nuclear power plant air defense fire was seen, although no explosions were
    reported. Hamas has fired at Israeli cities again today, with the Israeli
    government vowing vengeance. North Korea has pledged more troops to the war in
    Ukraine.
