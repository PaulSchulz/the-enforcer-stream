    The Russian Deputy Commander-In-Chief was killed today inside of the Kursk
    region after a HIMARS precision strike targeted and destroyed a headquarters in
    the area being used to coordinate Russian forces in the Sumy and Kursk Oblasts.
    Ukrainian forces launched a Storm Shadow missile attack on the Donetsk oblast
    today as well, with one missile shot down and others hitting their marks.
    Ukrainian forces held the line on most if ot all fronts, and inflicted heavy
    losses on the Russian army. The president ended a phone call with Putin and
    stated that he is very dissapointed as Putin has made it clear he will not end
    the war. Iranian proxy forces, the Quds, took a seirous loss as their leader was
    killed inside of Southern Leabanon today. the PRC has stated that they cannot
    let Russia lose as that would focus all US attention on the Chinese instead.
