  description: |
    Ukrainian forces successfully attacked and destroyed the MiG Factory in
    Moscow which produces all variants of the MiG-29 in service with the Russian air
    force, and all spare parts as well. Russia has now started to float the idea of
    scrapping the Admrial Kuznetsov due to repeated failures to refit the vessel and
    put it out to sea. A major pipeline also burst in Russia, resulting in a loss of
    vital fuel sources for the time. Another top level official has died in Tehran
    today although the cuase of death is currently unknown. US RC-135 Rivet Joint
    aircraft have taken to the skies in the middle east to gather intel for future
    strikes possibly being planned against Iran's houthi forces in western Yemen.
    The US senate has approved 500 million for Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have held
    the line and inflicted high casulaties on the Russian armed forces over the
    course of the day.
