    North Korea has threatened war against the US, Japan, And South Korea as
    the three nations conducted military exercises today in the Sea of Japan. This
    comes as North Korea vows unlimited military support to the Russian Federation
    and has already provided 12 million shells in support of the Russian war effort
    so far. Russia is in full panic over further US support, as thery are noe
    concerned that this will give Ukraine the ability to strike into Russia's deeper
    earas in Moscow and Beyond, and give Ukraine an even greater destructive edge.
    Ukrainian forces managed to push the Russians back today in Sumy, and have
    inflicted heavy losses on the Russians once again. Iran has vowed they are still
    working towards nuclear weapons.
