    EUCOM BE LIKE DON'T THREATEN BECAUSE WE WILL END AN MFER, THEY ARE ABOUT THAT
    BUSINESS. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    The US EUCOM Commander has stated that if Russia starts a war in Europe they
    will encircle and destroy all Russian forces in Kaliningrad almost instantly,
    sending a direct threat to the Russian army about their lack fo fighting
    abilities and the futil concept of war with NATO. Russian banks are tetering on
    the edge of collapse due to heavy sanctions and are quietly asking the Russian
    government for bailouts. The economic situation is so bad in Russia that an
    additional 15 trillion rubles has been apporved to be printed and distributed
    across the economy. Meanwhile Syrian Tribal Army forces have been making their
    way to Suwayda to conduct crimes against humanity, with the Syrian Interim
    government largely quiet to the situation. China has conducted some low level
    coercion around the Taiwanese island today, and another explosion occured in
    Tehran.
