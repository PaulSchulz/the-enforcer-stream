  description: |
    The Supreme Allied Commander Alexis Grynkewich has stated that war in Europe
    against the Russian Federation is invetibale within the next year and a half,
    and US and allied forces are continuing to race towards rapidly rearming and
    preparing for the conflcit that is soon to arrive across the face of the
    continent. The US has now deployed B-61 Tactical Nuclear Bombs to RAF Lakenheath
    in the UK for the first time since 2005, signalling a massive shift in US combat
    readiness, and also denoting a nuclear deterrence stance. Meanwhile the
    Ceasefire in syria has completely collapsed, Tribal army forces continue to
    attack the city and there seems to be no end in sight to the crimes against
    humanity that are being conducted in the area. Azerbaijan has openly stated
    support in Ukraine's resistance against Russia, as Ukrainian armed forces
    continue to inflict high losses on the Russians. More drones attacked Moscow and
    other key targets overnight.
