    Iran has conducted an armed showdown with the USS Fitzgerald in the Gulf Of
    Oman earlier today, once again showing the aggressive stance of the Iranian
    Regime as they continue to work towards a nculear weapon. The United States and
    Israel are still sizing up future armed strikes against Iran, as they have also
    made it clear that the explosions happening across Iran are from foreign agents
    conducting sabotage. Massive Ukrainian attacks have hit Sochi and Adler further
    south, destroying a fuel depot and other vital resources within the small port.
    Ukraine has also attacked bases in Simferopol and Sevastapol, with fires and
    smoke seen in both cities. Russia and Ukraine concluded their third round of
    talks today without any progress, as Ukrainian forces keep inflicting high
    casualties.
