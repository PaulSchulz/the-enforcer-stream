    Thailand has declared martial law throughtout large parts of the border
    regions as the Prime Minister of the country has declared a state of total war
    against Cambodia. Cambodian armed forces are attempting offensives in several
    areas of the border supported by heavy rocket fire, while the Thai armed forces
    supress the attempted advances with artillery fire and airstrikes. The USS
    Nimitz arrived in Thailand earlier showing US support for the Taiwenese position
    in the fight. SIG forces in Syria, charged with keeping the Peace in the Suwayda
    region have now resoted to attacks against the Druze in the city, already
    escelating a very fragile situation. Ukrainian forces have launched attacks
    several hours ago aimed at the Kerch Bridge although no damage has been reported
    yet, leaving the efficacy of the attack in question. Ukrainian forces continue
    to hold their lines in eastern Ukraine.
