      Major battles continue to rage on the Thai-Cambodian border as both sides
      prepare to conduct attempted peace talks in Kuala Lumpur as the war has now
      become one of the deadliest conflicts in the region since the 1980's. Thai and
      Cambodian forces have conducted heavy shelling of each side, resulting in the
      deaths of more soldiers and civilians. The leader of the Iranian backed Yemeni
      Houthis has now declared a complete blockade of the Southern Red sea, claiming
      any vessel with a shred of affiliation with Israel will be attacked, captured,
      or destroyed. This comes as the president of the United States has made clear
      that Iran's insistence on nuclearization will not be tolerated by the US
      government. Hezbollah is preparing for a new offensive against Israel. Ukraine
      has attacked key logistical targets into Southern Russia again, attempting to
      destroy a vital land corridor. Ukrainians forces are now destabilizing the
      Russian Sumy front heavily, as Russian losses continue to mount. The US is
      preparing to heavily sanction the Russians, as the US now believes that peace is
      not possible with the Russians. The US has publicly stated that the Venezuelan
      Government in illegitimate.
