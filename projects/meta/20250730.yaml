  morse: |
    RUSSIA REFUSING THE ULTIMATUM IS A CLEAR SIGN OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN SAYING FOR A
    YEAR. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Nato troops have begun to deploy to the Belarussian border after a Russian
    drone flew over the capitol of Lithuania yesterday. The President of the United
    States has demanded an answer from the Russians on the peace talks, and the
    Russians have responded with outright threats against the US and NATO, and have
    also stated that they will continue the war. The President has responded by
    stating he is disappointed in the lack of Russian response. Meanwhile Ukraine
    has committed massive strikes across the Russian Federation and on key logistics
    sites inside of the Russian Don Region. The ceasefire between Cambodia and
    Thailand has collapsed, as heavy fighting has begin on the border. Iran is
    attempting to excavate the Fordow enrichment plant.
