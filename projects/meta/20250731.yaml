  description: |
    Chinese forces of the People's Liberation Army are beginning to noticeably
    build up forces inside the South China Sea as they continue to remp up their
    offensive rhetoric against Taiwan and respond to the threat of tariffs and
    sanctions for the continued purchase of Russian oil. China has refused the US's
    demand to stop the purchase of Russian oils and gases in light on impending
    tariffs and sanctions, stating they will financially support the Russians
    throught the purchases. Ukrainian special forces have raided a Russian fort
    built on an abandoned oil rig off of the coast of Crimea, and also raided a
    peninsula near to the Dnipro Estuary. Russia has doubled down publicly today
    once again stating they will not stop the war. Israel bombed Ammo depots near
    the Latakia area today. The US is now applying heavier sanctions to the Republic
    of India.
