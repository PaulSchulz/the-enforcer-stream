  description: |
    A large buildup of Chinese forces has been seen in Fujian province of China
    in the Eastern Theater Command as Chinese naval exercises are being conducted in
    the southern end of the Taiwan Strait. Chinese aircraft have entered Taiwanese
    airspace for a short period of time before turning back, this all coming just
    hours after the Taiwanese deputy foreign minister said that invasion by the
    Chinese was imminent and only a matter of time. Meanwhile Ukraine has striked
    deep into Russia, hitting major oil refineries and the largest one in Russia
    near to Nizhny Novgorod took a major blow from a Ukrainian drone attack.
    Analysts have warned that Russia may attempt to use a nuclear weapon on Ukraine
    to force an end to the war, as Ukrainian forces continue to inflict high losses
    and have pushed the Russians back in some areas. The Special envoy to the US is
    expected to arrive in Moscow in the next few hours to most likely hear the final
    decision of the Russian government on edning the war, with the answer most
    likely being a resounding no.
