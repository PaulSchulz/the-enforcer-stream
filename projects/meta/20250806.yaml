    RUSSIA PREPARES FALSE FLAG ATTACK, DEPLOYS BALLISTIC MISSILES! Breaking War News
    With The Enforcer
  morse: |
    RUSSIANS GETTING ALL OF IT'S DUCKS IN A ROW TO START A WAR IN EUROPE. THE
    MESSAGE IS CLEAR. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    The Russian Federation is preparing for a false flag attack after the
    Russians published a report stating that Brtiain is preparing to conduct bombing
    attacks on merchant shipping to spite the Russian Federation's violation of
    sanctions. Meanwhile the Russians have withdrawn from the moratorium on the
    deployment of SRBM and IRBM missiles in europe, meaning that Iskanders and other
    types of missiles can be deployed toward european countries. Israel has decided
    to occupy the Gaza strip, and possibly annex it in the future. The ceasefire
    between the Indians and Pakistanis have collapsed as fire breaks out near the
    border town of Poonch. Time is ticking for the Russians to reach a deal over a
    peace in Ukraine, and a US envoy will speak to the Russians tomorrow. Iran has
    suffered a massive explosion in Shiraz, with US fdorces quietly moving out of
    Syria and Iraq.
