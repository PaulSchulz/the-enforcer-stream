    A major attack has been conducted by Ukrainian forces on Russia Refineries in
    the Don regions, with refineries round the city of Krasnodar all hit and burning
    after a crippling Ukrainian drone attack. Russian Federation armed forces were
    not able to stop the attacks and appear to suffer another major blow to Russia's
    refinery abilities. Massive explosions have rocked Tahran and Isfahan today, as
    major explosions continue to damage vital facilities. Lebanon and the US have
    agreed to disarm Hezbollah, with the group now attempting to rally in Beirut.
    Operation Talisman Sabre is currently underway in the pacific, with India now
    temporaily halting their imports of Oil from Russia. Ukraine has held the line
    and inflicted heavy losses onto the Russian armed forces.
