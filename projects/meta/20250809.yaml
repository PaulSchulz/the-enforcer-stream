    LITHUANIA DEMANDS NATO ARMED SUPPORT, EXPLOSIONS ACROSS RUSSIA! Breaking War
    News W/ The Enforcer
  morse: |
    RUSSIA IS GETTING AWAY WITH APPEASEMENT AGAIN, THIS IT ABSOLUTELY INSANE. LLTLSA! 
  description: |
    As the Deadline for Russia to reach a ceasefire has arrived today, Lithuania
    has made an official request for armed NATO support in light of continued
    Russian military buildups and the persistent threats of Russian air attacks. The
    United States has now completely backed off of the ultimatum which has arrived
    on this date, and is now planning on meeting Putin in Alaska in several days,
    attempting to reach an end to the war without including Ukrainians in the
    negotiations. Explosions have occured throughout all of Southern Russia as more
    drone attacks target and destroy key Russian Infrastructure. The Ukrainians have
    made it clear they will not accept the loss of land in the megotiations, and
    will continue on fighting if necessary. India has begun solidifying their
    position as a friend of Russia once more, as large Chinese air force activity
    was seen in the Taiwan Strait.
