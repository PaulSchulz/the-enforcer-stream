    Ukrainian armed forces have conducted a ground invasion into the Bryansk
    Oblast earlier today, pushing into a small village and holding the position for
    some time. Russia suffered heavier attacks in Tatarstan as Ukrainian drones
    truck key facilities vital for the Russian Federation. International
    condemnation has been made of the proposed US Russia peace talks in Alaska, with
    the Baltic states saying if Ukrainian territory is given away they will become
    the next to be invaded by the Russians. Over 111 Chinese aircraft were spotted
    in the Taiwan strait earlier today, marking the largest number since early
    october of 2024 last year. Iran is now stating that they will be finding the
    Mossad agents inside of their country, while Ukraine continues to inflict high
    losses and hold the line.
