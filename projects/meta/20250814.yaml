    RUSSIA DEPLOYS NUKES ON POLISH BORDER, RUSSIAN ADVANCE STOPPED! Breaking War
    News With The Enforcer
  morse: |-
    NOW RUSSIA IS PUTTING POSSIBLE NUCLEAR ARMED WEAPONS IN ZAPAD?! LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Russia deploys nuclear forces directly along the Polish border with Belarus
    which will take an active part in the upcoming Zapad 2025 military exercise,
    which in it's design is simulating a Russian offensive to take the Suwalki Gap.
    We have not yet heard an official repsonse from the Foreign ministry of Poland
    or the Department of State in the US. Russia is also planning on testing a new
    nuclear powered ICBM capable of striking the United States during the Alaska
    summit on Friday. The Russian advance in Pokrovsk was stopped entirely by
    Ukrainian forces, although future attempts at encircling Russian advancing
    forces seems uncertain. Israel has continued it's offensive within the Gaza
    strip, and also killed another Hezbollah leader in Southern Lebanon. Azerbaijan
    is threatening the Russians in repsonse to the Russians suggesting they will
    invade the country. Iran has tested some ballistic missiles in the western
    region of the country, while a border infiltration attempt appears to have been
    conducted by Pakistani forces in Jamu and Kashmir overnight.
