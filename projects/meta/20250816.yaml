  description: |
    President Putin of the Russian Federation was visibly threatened today at
    the Anchorage Alaska summit, as US stealth bombers and multirole fighters roared
    overhead. The red carpet was surrounded by F-22 fighters, as the grim topic of a
    possible end to war was soon to be discussed. The talks ended with no clear
    change in the Russian position, and no deal was made at all. Russian journalists
    were treated with the utmost disgrace, showing further contempt by the US
    government. The Russian army has been encircled by the Ukrainian 1st National
    Guard Corps north of Pokrovsk, with nearly an entire battalion level unit stuck
    in the encirclement. Ukrainian drones rained down endless destruction on Russian
    refineries and key sites in the country. A Russian ship in Astrakhan carrying
    munitions was hit and destroyed at it's mooring.
