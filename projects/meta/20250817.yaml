    RUSSIA IS GETTING SLAMMED A LITTLE HERE AND THERE ON THE FRONT, NOT VERY NICE LOOK. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Russian armed forces have now been surrounded outside of Pokrovsk for nearly
    24 hours now with no signs of a breakout, the 1st National Guard Corps of
    Ukraine continues to wear down the remaining Russians inside of the pocket. The
    Russian army is still making no advances into the city of Pokrovsk, while the
    impact of yesterday's negotiations still loom over Ukraine. The President has
    now invited Zelensky and european leaders to the White House this next friday.
    Ukraine has already made it clear that all Russian demands made are
    unacceptable. Poland has stated that this moment is a pivotal one, and can
    define the outcome for the entire of eastern europe. The damage caused by the
    largest Ukrainian drone attack of the war is still being uncovered, and it
    appears that the Russians took severe losses. Israel is continuing their
    campaign in the Gaza strip, and an explosion was reported inside Damascus. China
    is continuing to flesh out their military capabilities and still conducting low
    level coercion in the strait.
