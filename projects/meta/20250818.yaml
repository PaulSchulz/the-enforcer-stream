  description: |
    The Islamic Republic of Iran has suffered from a large series of explosions
    throughout the day in Tehran, as The Iranian government makes it clear that war
    with Israel and the US is imminent. Multiple national embassies in Iran have
    already shut down, with their embassy staff leaving the country today, signaling
    that conflict could start again within weeks. Russia is officially running out
    of gas as fuel supplies have been shut off to most occupied territories, and can
    only be acquired through a coupon system. This is also as the Russian Federation
    continues preparations for the Zapad Exercises in Belarus, and as Ukrainian
    armed forces continue to besiege the lost battalion near Pokrovsk. The Peopleâ€™s
    Republic of China is also continuing to prepare their armed forces for a future
    war with Taiwan, displaying military air defense drills, and also readying for
    the military parade which will showcase new Chinese equipment.
