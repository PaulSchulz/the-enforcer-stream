    SURROUNDED RUSSIAN FORCES DESTROYED, IRANIAN CITY WITHOUT WATER! Breaking
    War News W/ The Enforcer
  morse: |
    RUSSIAN ARMED FORCES JUST LOST 1 ONE OF THE 2 POCKETS AT POKROVSK, IT'S OVER FOR
    THEM. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    The Zoloti Kolodyaz Pocket has been officially destroyed and retaken by
    Ukrainian forces; a resounding victory as the remaining forces of the pocket
    have broken through to the Kucheriv Yar pocket with the remainder of the
    batallion making a last stand there. The Fighting 93rd has been deployed with
    the charge of destroying in detail the remnants of the 132nd Brigade's lost
    battalion, with heavy bombardments and assaults taking place. A calculating
    error in the Iranian government has left the entire city of Khorrambad with a
    population of 370,000 people without water, with Iranian authorities now saying
    they will be left without water for several days. The Iranians are now also
    facing a critical natural gas shortage as well, with the stock market plummeting
    22 percent. Iran still maintains it's hostile posturing towards the US and
    Israel. A US special forces raid was conducted near Idlib earlier today, and the
    Communist Chinese plan on unveiling a new ICBM in the upcoming parade. Gas
    shortages are becoming even more pronounced in Russia, as now 92 gas is also
    unavailbable in the occupied territories, and a Russian fuel train was destroyed
    South of Tokmak.
