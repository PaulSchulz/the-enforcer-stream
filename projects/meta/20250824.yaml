  description: |
    Russian frontlines across Ukraine are beginning to suffer from frontline
    collapses as Ukrainian forces threaten Russian forces east of Pokrovsk with
    encirclement. Russian forces are being pushed back in southern Donetsk and near
    the Seberansky forest as well, as Ukraine continues to beat Russia back along
    most of the front currently. Russia is preparing for false flag provocations, as
    state media in Russia begins to claim that estonia is preparing to conduct
    attacks on the Russian Deferation, laying the groundwork for a possible prelude
    to an invasion of the small baltic state. The Kursk Nuclear Power Plant has
    suffered a fire, although the Russians downplay the seriousness, it is a very
    concerning development. Russian gas shrtages are beginning to sporadically pop
    up throughout the country, showing fuel supplies are reaching the utter brink of
    collapse. More news has come out about the DMZ, North Korean soldiers had
    crossed the border.
