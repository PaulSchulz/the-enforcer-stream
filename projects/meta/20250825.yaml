    With The Enforcer 1278
  morse: |
    THE RUSSIANS HAD A BREAK THROUGH AND THEN GOT BROKEN THROUGH BY UKRAINE.
    LLTLSA!
  description: |
    24,000 Russian Soldiers have been effectively encircled at Pokrovsk from a
    Ukrainian counterattack that has pushed through a gap in the Russian lines.
    Currently it appears this will become a complete encirclement in roughly 24-48
    hours, meaning this may be the single largest frontline defeat by either side
    during the entire war. This comes as reports rang out that the Kerch bridge is
    once again under attack, with Dozens of Ukrainian drones flying right over the
    sea of Azov to the bridge. Ukrainian drones also hit Russian barracks nearby.
    Ukrainian drones hit and destroyed the Port of Ust-Luga, hitting the facility
    that is responsible for transporting the natural gas onto the ships. The Russian
    Federation has effectively ended talks today claiming the Ukrainian government
    is illegitimate and will not accept any deal made with them. Israel conducted an
    air campaign against the Houthis, striking the city of Sanaa.
