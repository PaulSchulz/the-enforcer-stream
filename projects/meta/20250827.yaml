  description: |
    Russian forces are being pushed back further in Donestk, with Ukrainian
    armed forces conducting counterattacks in southern Donetsk and Pokrovsk. 7
    Russian Brigades are still under an effective encirclement, although Ukrainian
    forces have not been able to create a complete encirclement. The Russian
    agricultural industry is in a state of near collapse, with Russia having to put
    a moratorium on the bankruptcies of Russian farmers; thgis lets us know that the
    Russian famring sector is already collapsing, and an attempt is being made to
    stop a complete collapse. Fuel shortages are worsening, the Kurill Islands are
    now without fuel, and a drone exploded in Estonia. It is unknown if it was a
    Russian drone, or a Ukrainian drone. China is continuing a purge of the PLA,
    while India is beginning to reduce their imports of Russian oil but not stopping
    them entirely. some officials in Iran are beginning to call Russian arms trading
    a "scam," showing the relations ebtween the two may collapse.
