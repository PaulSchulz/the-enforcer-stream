  description: |
    A massive NATO submarine manhunt is now underway in the Norwegian Sea
    after a Russian Submarine radioed a threat to the USS Gerald R. Ford and then
    immediately dived below the thermal layer, disappearing on the sonars of the
    strike group. currently the search has been ongoing since Sunday, with no signs
    being found of the submarine, or the other 2 that have set sail from Murmansk.
    Russian missiles have slammed into the city of Pripyat inside of the Chernobyl
    Exclusion Zone. the 3 missiles were directly targeted into the abandoned city
    for unknown reasons, but exploded within a few miles of the Chernobyl Nuclear
    Power Plant's sarcophagus. Ukrainian forces are continuing to hold the line and
    inflict casualties on Russian forces, with the situation appearing challenging
    for Russian forces north of Pokrovsk which are still in an effective
    encirclement. Israeli forces conducted large raids in southern Syria, with
    rumors a high level Iranian official was captured in the process.
