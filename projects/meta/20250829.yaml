    Russian drones have been confirmed by German and American authorities to
    have violated German airspace, flying deep into the country in an attempt to
    gather info on arms shipments heading to Ukraine. Such drones have been seen
    around sensitive facilites such as the Ramstein airbase among many others.
    Currently a massive NATO-wide manhunt is being conducted for what is believed to
    be either a Yasen or Akula class submarine that threatened the Gerland R Ford
    Strike Group under the command of 6th fleet. NATO aircraft from multiple
    countries are scouring the northern oceans looking for any signs of the
    dangerous submarine. Major airstrikes were condcuted against Houthi forces
    today, with their prime minister being announced killed in the strikes. Iran is
    still in possesion of enriched Uranium and the US is considering war with
    Venezuela.
