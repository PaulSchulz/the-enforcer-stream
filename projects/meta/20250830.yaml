  description: |
    Germany declares conflict with the Russian Federation, making claims the
    Russia is conducting direct hostile actions against the Federal Republic of
    Germany and that it may as well be an official state of war that exists between
    the two countries. This also comes as EU commisioner Ursula Von Der Leyen has
    stated that Putin is a "predator," preying on the western world's demise for
    Russia's gain. Ukrainian armed forces have continued to hold their lines today
    across the front, hitting and damaging key sites inside of the country including
    more refineries. Venezuela appears to be mobilizing the armed forces in repsonse
    to the US buildup in the area. The US delegation in Taiwan claimed Taiwan has a
    right to self determination, which will inflame rhetoric from the communist
    chinese.
