    The Venezuela Air Force has buzzed the US Warship USS Jason Dunham armed
    with Air to Surface munitions. A show of forces by the Venezuelan Government and
    a direct threat to the warships under the command of Second Fleet. The United
    States has vowed that they will destroy more narco vessels previously, and no
    official response has been made to the buzzing of the warship just yet. Ukraine
    has slammed more refineries and fuel storage depots in Russia; the refinery in
    Ryazan is burning and the fuel depot in Luhansk has taken severe damage. US
    forces were attacked inside Somalia today, while news has emerged that the US
    conducted secret talks with Taiwan in Alaska.
