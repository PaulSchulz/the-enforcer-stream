    THE MARINES PRACTICING LANDINGS AT PUERTO RICOH MMMM SOMETHING SEEMS UP. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    US forces prepare for an Invasion of Venezuela, with the Amphibious Ready
    Group conducting amphibious landing drills in Puerto Rico, in preparation for
    future US action against Venezuela. The President has ordered for the US navy to
    engage and destroy Venezuelan fighters that enter the air defense perimeter
    around the 2nd Fleet. A Botched US Seal Team Six raid has been released to the
    public, where in 2019 a seal team six raid was conducted into North Korea to set
    up a listening post and ended in failure after the team engaged civilians
    mistaking them as the KPA (Korean People's Army). Fuel shortages now grip the
    Moscow citizens with panic, as more gas stations run dry through the city.
    Israel has now planned to annex a large part of the Western Bank, and the plan
    is bveing considered. Meanwhile India has refused US demands on Russian oil
    purchases. Ukraine has held the line inflicting heavy casualties and pushing the
    Russian northern flank back.
