    LLTLSA!
  description: |
    The USS Gerald R Ford is now hovering right outside of the Russian port of
    Murmansk; home to the Russian Northern Fleet. This aircraft carrier is one of
    the msot advanced and heavily armed, and appears to be posturing agains the
    Russian Federation. Russia has now publicly announced the buildup of troops and
    bases along the finnish border "for Russian defense," although the action is
    overtly aggressive. US forces continue to amass in Puerto Rico, with the Marines
    conducting more landing drills and Eletronic jamming now occuring against the
    Venezuelans. A drone crashed into Poland, although polish authorities state it
    is not an armed drone, but appears to be a smuggler's. Iran will soon hold a
    vote on whether they will withdraw from the nonproliferation treaty.
