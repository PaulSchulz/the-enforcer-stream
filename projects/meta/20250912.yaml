    NATO has stated that they will respond to the attack the Russian Federation
    conducted on Poland where nearly 20 Russian drones violated their airspace and
    began to penetrate deep into the country. As 40,000 Polish Soldiers mobilize to
    the border regions in preparation for the Russian Zapad exercises Poland has now
    closed all of their national borders with Russian and Belarus. The Russians have
    responded with a direct threat of war if the borders are not reopened. Russia
    continued to grapple with worsening fuel shortages, while the US and NATO
    continue to grapple with indecisive leadership, as multiple countries including
    the US are straying away from calling the Russian action against Poland an
    attack. Ukrainian forces have held their lines today on all major fronts, and
    have inflicted sizeable losses onto the Russian army.
