    Poland and Lithuania has deployed 60,000 troops around the Suwalki gap as
    the Russian Deferation has kicked off it's Zapad 2025 Military exercise less
    than a mile from the border of the Suwalki Gap. The NATO Response will be joined
    by a fleet 17 ships strong in the Baltic, and Operation Eastern Sentry comprised
    of a multinational air force tasked with shooting down any Russian incursion.
    Russia is conducting land air and sea operations around Grodna, North of Norway,
    and in Kaliningrad. Belraus is now preparing the test of a "nuclear" armed
    Oreshnik hypersonic missile. it is unknown if it will carry a live warhead, but
    the test will simulate the operations of an Oreshnik as if it was armed witha
    nuclear warhead. Ukrainian armed forces have struck the port of Primorsk today,
    causing major damage and leading to a ship at port catching on fire. Ukraine has
    also held the line today, and inflicted further losses.
