    be aimed at Warsaw and Vilnius. These missiles appeared armed and ready to fire
    at a moment's notice towards NATO countries. Russian drones entered Romanian
    airspace hours ago and were chased down by Romanian F-16s. The drones were lost
    over the airspace, and the wreckage was found later. Polish forces are flooding
    into the Suwalki gap as polish citizens volunteer by the thousands to join the
    Polish armed forces in response to recent Russian drone attacks. Germany is also
