    Russia has declared a de-facto war with NATO during the midst of the ongoing
    Zapad-2025 military exercises. Putin himself personally visited the grounds
    north of Grodna to personally observe the armed forces conducting their actions.
    Ukraine conducted a shocking surprise attack from within Russia, blowing up an
    important base in the far-eastern city of Vladivostok, killing several soldiers
    of the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade. Russia's Transneft has declared they might
    conduct reductions in capacity which could affect 9% of all oil exports in the
    world. Venezuela suffered another loss as the US hit another narco boat off of
    their coast.
