    WHEN ARE WE TO STOP TAKING ALL OF THIS? THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS AND A HUGE
    PROVACATION. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Today several Russian Mig-31 aircraft breahced Estonian airspace and flew 5
    miles into the sovereign airspace of the Republic of Estonia. Swedish aircraft
    were rapidly sent to respond, while further south Russian aircraft buzzed polish
    drilling platforms off of the coast of the nation of Poland. Estonia has invoked
    article 4 of the NATO charter, and is now seeking consultation with other NATO
    nations on the crisis. The United States has hit another Venezuelan narco-boat
    off of the coast of Venezuela. Believed to be a part of Tren de Aragua it is
    believed that the US used munitions fired by drone to destroy the vessel. Maduro
    has decried the attack a string of attacks as a part of an undeclared war by the
    United States. Ukraine has held their lines today while the Russian Federation
    cannot help but admit even from it's largest voices and offices of government
    that the nation is now in a full-scale economic depression.
