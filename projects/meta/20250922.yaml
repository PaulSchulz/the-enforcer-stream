    US E-6b Mercury Command Aircraft has landed in Ramstein Germany today,
    responsible for the communication of orders to ballistic missile submarines of
    the US Navy in the area. this deployment is rare and has not been seen in years.
    The United Nations and NATO will be preparing to make a repsonse to the Russian
    violation of airspace in Estonia. A US Special Forces vessel has moved within
    close distance of Venezuela, the ship is specially outfitted for large scale
    operations of SOF, suggesitng that raids into Venezuela are becoming more of a
    future reality than a possibility. Venezuela is running static, asking to talk
    to the US while continuing to prepare it's armed forces; a stalling maneuver.
    Russia has taken several big hits from the Ukrainians today, while the front has
    seen barely any changes.
