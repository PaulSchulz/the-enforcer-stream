    The President Of The United States has ordered NATO forces to shoot down
    Russian Aircraft incurring in Russian airspace from this point forward. The
    President has voewd unconditional support to Ukraine and NATO, and has also
    stated confidence that Ukraine will be able to win back all of it's territory
    with the help of the might western alliance. Overnight Norway, Denmark, and
    Sweden have dealt with drone incursions that are believed to be launched from
    Russian ghost ships in the area, without Denmark calling the action an "attack."
    Russian stock markets have crashed today after the statements by the President,
    which is expected to cause a harsh reaction by the Russians. Iran has announced
    their first ICBM test launch successful, and are still working towards nuclear
    weapons. Ukraine launched a large dron attack on Crimea, and Russian fuel prices
    are skyrocketing unabeited.
