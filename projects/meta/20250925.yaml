    DANISH. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Russian drones have violated Danish Airspace across the whole nation, as
    aircraft have been scrambled across the country and Police are aiming to find
    and shoot down the drones that are flying acorss the country. Some of these
    drones are flying over military airfields housing the F-16s and F-35s of the
    Danish Air Force. Thailand is mobilizing more forces to the Border with cambodia
    after 4 Royal Cambodian Army soldiers crossed the border, and engaged in a short
    firefight. Tensions are rising fast, and it seems that the ceasefire may not
    hold much longer. Ukrainian drones conducted a massive attack on the Russian
    Black Sea ports of Tuapse and Novorossiysk causing heavy damage in both. Russian
    refineries have been obliterated further today, and the Russians are seeing the
    economic situation worsen farther. Ukraine has held it's lines and caused heavy
    losses on attacking Russian forces.
