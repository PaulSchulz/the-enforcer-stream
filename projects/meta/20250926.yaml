    Russia has declared that they are in a state of war with NATO after European
    representatives issued a notice to the Russian Federation that any further
    Incursions into NATO airspace will result in the offending aircraft being shot
    down by NATO forces. Russia further stated they will go into a full-scale war,
    beyond the hybrid one they are conducting if any armed action. NATO forces are
    now encircling Kaliningrad Oblast, with several E-3 Sentries flying around the
    Russian exclave. Denmark is suffering another drone incursion, with Danish
    authorities describing the action as directly hostile and conducted by a foreign
    nation. A Russian Ropucha class landing ship has been spotted south of the
    Danish islands, and the Danish authorities are trying to find suspicion to begin
    boarding and searching vessels in the area. Russia is spiraling further into
    chaos, while Ukrainian forces hold back a new Russian offensive which started
    today.
