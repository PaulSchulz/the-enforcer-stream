    MASSIVE NATO AIR OPERATIONS IN EUROPE, CHINA THREATENS US! Breaking War News
    With The Enforcer
  morse: |
    NATO IS DOING GOOD WITH THIS SHOW OF FORCE TODAY, BUT THEY SHOULD SHOOT THE
    DRONES DOWN. LLTLSA!
  description: |
     A massive NATO air operation has been conducted over the whole of Europe
     earlier today, as nearly a dozen aerial fuel tankers took off, along with
     multiple surveillance and command aircraft, and possibly anywhere to 44 to 55
     combat aircraft in the sky at the same time. This is the largest air operation
     in the NATO alliance seen in recent years, and appears to be a show of force
     against the Russian Federation. China has threatened the US in a joint statement
     made with Russia, Iran, and Pakistan that no US bases should be opened or
     operated around Afghanistan. Iran is racing to develop their nuclear weapons in
     the meantime, working feverishly at the Pickaxe mountain site to bring it to
     operational speed. Russia is also conducting flights to Kaliningrad. The US is
     planning on strikes inside of Venezuela within the next few weeks. Ukrainian
     forces have held the line today, causing losses and also hitting deep inside of
     Russia.
