    KILO SUBMARINES SEEM TO HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF FAILURE, JUST ASK THE CARTEL ABOUT
    IT. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    A Russian Kilo Class Submarine, The Novorossiysk, has suffered a critical
    failure forcing the submarine to surface several miles off the coast of Spain.
    The submarine is believed to be on the verge of an explosion, and is in critical
    condition. Through Russian mismanagement of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear powerplant,
    and it's existence in an acitve warzone, the powerplant has been disconnected
    from the power grid and is now on the verge of a complete meltdown in about 16
    days if power is not restored to the reactors. Russian foreign minister Sergai
    Lavorov has stated that the Russians are not conducting provocations against the
    west, although they are, and that any actions against Russian in any way will
    result in a total war against NATO. Drones have now been spotted over almsot all
    of northern Europe, and more forces are bieng moved into the area to repsond to
    Russian provocations. Ukraine has held the lines today and inflicted heavy
    casaulties onto Russian forces.
