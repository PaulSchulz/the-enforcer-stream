    RUSSIA DOESN'T HAVE THE POWER, THE LIGHTS ARE OFF, AND THE GAS IS OUT.
    LLTLSA!

    Russia suffers from massive attacks in the Belgorod and Bryansk regions, as
    Ukraine has started to turn the tables on the Russians. Drones slammed down into
    the Belgorod powerplant causing an immediate blackout with no foreseeable future
    of turning the grid back on. In Bryansk a critical facility was hit by what
    appears to be a HIMARS Attack using GMLRS missiles. China is racing to convert
    civilian ferries into military use, giving note that China is preparing to
    invade Taiwan as soon as possible. Iran is now openly stating they are working
    on creating nuclear weapons after sanctions were snapped back onto Iran. Drones
    have been sighted over a wide area of Europe again today, and Ukraine states
    they have intelligence that these drones are 100% Russian. Ukraine has held the
    lines today and continues to cause large amounts of damage to Russian forces.
