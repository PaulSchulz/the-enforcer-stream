    Russia declares national emergency over the crippling fuel crisis in the
    country, as msot Russian sources of usable fuel products have run out. Russi
    must either buy fuel imports from foreign countries or face a near-total fuel
    shortage. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant has been declared a crisis by Zelensky
    as the nuclear powerplant has been without power from the external grid for
    nearly a week. The US is flooding into the middle east with fuel tankers and
    additional transport aircraft again as rumors have circled that Israel and the
    US are preparing for further strikes against the Islamic Republic of Iran. The
    Yemeni houthis have announced they will now attack US ships transiting the
    southern Red Sea. The US has also announced they will be conducting imminent
    strikes againt the nation of Venezuela. Further drone incursions have occured
    across europe, and the europeans are working on collective defense. Ukraine has
    held the line, inflicting heavy casualties on the Russian Federation.
