    HWAT! LLTLSA!

    The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Powerplant is in a worse condition than
    anticipated, according to the IAEA. IAEA officials have stated that the plant
    may only have several days left before a complete nuclear meltdown occurs due to
    a lack of coolant flow through the reactors of the powerplant. Russian forces
    also hit critical power systems in the Chernobyl exclusion zone knocking out
    power for hours before it was restored. The French armed forces have been told
    they must be ready for war "by this very night," as the French begin to position
    themselves again as a defender of Europe. Ukraine has knocked out 40% of
    Russia's oil refining abilities, with Russia now having to import fuel. a large
    amount of E-6B mercuries were airborne over the US today, possibly a part of a
    prepardness drill. Israel is openly suggesting strikes on Iran may be coming
    soon.
