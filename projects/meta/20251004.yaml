    The US has conducted another strike on a Venezuelan boat off the coast of
    the country of Venezuela, as the United States continues to press forward with
    their actions against cartel groups and the Venezuelan government in South
    America. US SOUTHCOM published more videos and information about the actions
    made in the area. 6 E-6B Mercury nuclear command aircraft once again took off
    inside of the United States. this is becoming an interesting occurence as this
    is the second day in a row such an event has happened, and it's usually rare to
    see such a large number airborne at any moment. Drones were spotted over
    Belgium, Munisch, and Prague today with the forces of each country observing
    them. a peace deal appears to have been agreed upon between the US, Isreal, and
    Hamas to release the remaining hostages and end the war in the Gaza strip.
    Ukraine striked targets deep inside Russia once again at the foothill of the
    Urals, while holding back Russian forces inside of Ukraine.
