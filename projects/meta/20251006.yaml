    IS RUSSIA GOING TO ACT BIG AND TOUGH WHEN ANYTHING CAN TAKE THE WHOLE COUNTRY
    OUT? LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Russia has been crippled by massvie Ukrainian attacks which have not only
    targeted key refineries throughout the country but also major powerplants inside
    of them border regions. Russia has responded with large attacks against Ukraine,
    with Poland scrambling their jets in case of incursions. Belarus violated
    Lithuanian airspace today with a series of balloons that were carrying
    cigarettes and cigars, an incredibly odd occurence which left most of Lithuanian
    airspace shut down while the threat was assessed. The US has vowed that further
    strikes will occur on land in Venezuela, and that the situation is not yet over.
    Taiwan has announced live fire drills right on Chinese shores as a show of
    forces against Chinese agression.
