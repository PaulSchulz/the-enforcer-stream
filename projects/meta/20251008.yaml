    Putin has threatened the US with dire consequences if they are to go forward
    with supplying the Ukrainians with the Tomahawk cruise missile, which the US
    president has stated will be provided to the Ukrainians after they find out how
    they will use them. This will put almsot all targets in Russia under the
    Ukrainian crosshairs. Ukraine has conducted massive attacks deep inside of
    Russia, even hitting a refinery in Tyumen. Russian refineries and ammo plants
    have been hit across the entire of the country over the course of the day
    causing serious damage. The Israel and Hamas ceasefire attempt appears to be on
    shaky ground, as the negotiation do not see eye to eye on anything. Taiwan has
    been told by the US to prepare for Invasion as China speeds up their invasion
    plans. The US has halted all diplomatic efforts with Venezuela.
