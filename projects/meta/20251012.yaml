  description: |
    Afghan armed forces have conducted an armed invsion of Pakistan earlier
    today, along with major battles breaking out along the entire Afghan-Pakistani
    border. These actions are in repsonse to Pakistani airstrikes on Afghan cities
    and facilities throughout the country. Pakistani forces returned fire, and
    landed some major hits on border checkpoints along the border and approaching
    convoys. However, Afghanistan also hit Pakistan hard and was able to take 7
    Pakistani soldiers prisoner. Afghanistan has announced the cessation of actions,
    although this may be far form over. Russian armed forces were seen standing
    directly across the Estonian border today, leading Estonia to shut down their
    border crossings entirely with Russia. Putin has also made statements largely
    declaring a new nuclear arms race, and stating Russia will be unveiling new
    weapons. The ceasefire still holds in Gaza, as we await the release of the
    hostages. Ukrainian forces were able to hold the lines and take ground today in
    some areas of the front, while landing large hits inside of Russia.
