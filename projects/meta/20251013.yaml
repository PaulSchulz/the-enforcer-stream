    rebuilding it's efforts to be able to conduct a large scale invasion of the
    eastern flank of NATO in the very near future. Pakistan has Invaded Afghanistan
    in retaliation of the broder skirmishes and raids seen last night. Pakistani
    forces are continuing to strike Afghan forces, and the Pakistani government is
    refusing ceasefire talks. China has continued to escelate the trade war with the
    US, which has led to the President attempting to smooth relations with the
    Chinese. The US has also announced that Tomahawks will most likely be given to
    ukraine very soon, which has led to widespread panic in Moscow. Ukraine has held
    the lines and inflicted heavy losses onto the Russian forces throughout the day,
    even retaking ground in some areas.
