    The Afghan-Pakistani war continues with Pakistan taking clear control of the
    battlefield. Heavy firefights are being reported along the Paksitani border in
    some places, while in others Pakistan destroys Taliban armed forces and border
    checkpoints at will. Pakistan has not shown any interest in a ceasefire yet, and
    continue the war against the Taliban. Belarus has openly threatened the
    possibility of nuclear war if the US supplies Tomahawk cruise missiles to
    Ukraine. The United States has stated they will be making an announcement on the
    delivery of new weapons to Ukraine, most likely including the tomahawk missile.
    Russia's industries are now starting to move toward three day work weeks as the
    economy is entering it's final phases of collapse. China has stated they will
    continue their trade war against the US until "the end," and the US is now
    proposing further retaliatory actions. Ukrainian forces have fought with
    gallantry and honor, holding the Russians back and causing heavy casaulties.
