    Venezuela has announced the mobilization of "millions," of militia members
    as US inavsion looms heavy over the country. 17,000 troops of the Bolivarian
    Army have been deployed to the Colombian border, while all regular armed forces
    now are on high alert. The President of the United States has now made it clear
    that Venezuela has offered nearly everything it can to the US in prior offers,
    but the US will only settle with unconditional victory over Venezuela. Purges in
    China have continued, with top officials of the Central Military Committee being
    removed from officer today; some even being stripped of membership in the CCP.
    Battles now have emerged again between Afghanistan and Pakistan, as both sides
    broke the ceasefire hours before it's conclusion. Ukraine has hit and destroyed
    the Avangard plant at the foothill of the Ural mountains today, a deadly blow on
    Russia's abilities. The meeting between the US and Ukraine proved interesting
    with key developments.
