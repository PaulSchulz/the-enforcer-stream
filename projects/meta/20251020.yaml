    MAN MADURO IS GETTING REAL SCARED CAUSE THE US WON'T
    EVEN LET HIM TALK HIS WAY OUT. LLTLSA 
  description: |
    The US Commandant of the Marine Corps has warned that a major war is looming
    on the horizon, and that the US military and Marine Corps must be ready to face
    the coming threats to the nation that are imminent. Mass desertions are now
    plauging the ranks of the Russian army, with 25,000 men deserting in the last 9
    months, with the number now increasing in the last month alone. This comes as
    the US continues to conduct strikes on narco vessels within the Carribean. China
    has claimed the US cyberattacked them, while Taiwan hurries to prepare drone
    nets. A ceasefire was acheived in Pakistan and Afghanistan, while the ceasefire
    between Hamas and Israel already appears to be failing.
