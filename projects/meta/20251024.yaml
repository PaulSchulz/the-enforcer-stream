    Maduro has deployed a large number of air defense forces along the coast
    of the country as the United States is poised to conduct imminent strikes
    against the Venezuelan state. Venezuela has continued to make clear that it will
    defend itself, even against the overwhelming US presence within the region.
    Meanwhile Russia has been enraged over the implementation of sanctions against
    Lukoil and Rosneft, and is now threatening that any use of long range weapons
    will illicit a sever response. Russia has also violated Lithuania's airspace
    with an Il-78 and SU-30 flight, leading to spanish aircraft being scrambled in
    response. France is stating they need to be ready for war as soon as all
    possible. Israeli has declared if Hamas does not disarm then they will be forces
    to push back into the Gaza strip again.
