    WHAT'S A RUSSIAN GOTTA DO TO GET SOME OIL MONEY!!! WELL THEY GOTTA ASK FOR THE
    ENCHILADA! LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Russia is collapsing on the front lines and financially today as Ukrainian
    forces liberate Torske, and make major gains north of Pokrovsk. Russian banks
    are now openly declaring that Russia has hit 0% economic growth and is now
    shrinking rapidly, creating apocolyptic economic conditions inside Russia. It is
    now clear Russi'a ability to persist under these conditions may be hopeless, and
    the war will begin to end soon. Meanwhile US officials have ordered the USS
    Gerald R Ford carrier strike group to set sail to the Eastern Carribbean, making
    it clear that strikes will not begin until at least after the 1st of November,
    but they are inevitable.
