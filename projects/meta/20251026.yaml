    Russian forces are continuing to retreat near to the Pokrovsk battlefield,
    as Ukrainian forces continue to retake ground in the area. Russian forces
    attempted a counterattack to retake lost ground at Shakove to no avail, leaving
    them completely unable to reconsolidate their defensive lines. Major attacks
    also broke out in the streets of Moscow, with groups of armed migrants swarming
    the streets, and attacking passerbys wherever they found them. Russia continues
    it's campaign over Lithuania, with mroe balloons sighted. The Gerald R Ford is
    two weeks away from the carribbean, and the Hurricane in the area is growing
    larger. The US has made it clear they will not talk to Putin until it's clear
    that Russia actually wants peace. India and Pakistan appear to be preparing for
    war, while Pakistan is also prepping further strikes on the Taliban in
    Afghanistan.
