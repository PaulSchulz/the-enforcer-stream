#  Russia has successfully fired the Burevestnik Nuclear Powered Cruise
#  missile today. A nuclear armed cruise missile powered by a Nuclear Reactor;
#  giving it an unlimited range. Russian officials immediately used the successful
#  launch to insinuate future attacks on the west for their sanctions on Russia.
#  Ukrainian forces conducted a massive attack on Moscow, which began to overwhelm
#  air defenses. Russian technicals were seen dotted around the Kremlin waiting for
#  the drones to enter the area. India and Pakistan are now engagin in the Leepa
#  valley area currently, showing war is now coming. Peace was secured between
#  Thailand and Cambodia through a ratified peace traty, which also grew Us
#  connections to the two kingdoms. Hurricane Melissa is building in strength,
#  halting operations in the area for now.
 
#  Tonight's Fundraiser is for Razom for Ukraine, make sure to support to show the
#  world that our way of life will persevere!
