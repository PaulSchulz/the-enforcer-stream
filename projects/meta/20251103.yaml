    Russia has suffered from a crippling attack overnight after Ukrainian drones
    slammed down into major cities, ports, and infrastructure around the whole of
    the Russian Federation. Russia is dealing poorly with these attacks, but still
    insists on not allowing for any possible talks with the us or Ukraine about
    possibly ending the war. meanwhile more drones have been spotted over military
    bases and nuclear facilities in Belgium, housing the US B61 nuclear gravity
    bombs. US forces continue to prepare for future action against Venezuela, with
    more forces moving into the area and existing facilites being built out. the USS
    Gerlad R Ford is on the way, although it's progress seems to be slow. Ukraine
    has landed major hits on Russian forces across the frontlines, and have stopped
    most if not all Russian advances over the course of the day.
