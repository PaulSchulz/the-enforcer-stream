    BARBARIC TO THREATEN TO OFFICIALLY NUKE A COUNTRY
    AS A JOKE OF SOME SORT. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Russian drones have invaded Belgian airspace over to whole country, which
    has invoked article 4 over the incidents; a makor act to be taken once more by
    another NATO member. Drones were also spotted over the Hannover airport in
    central Germany today as well. Russia is now threatening open nuclear warfare on
    Ukraine after announcing the resumption of full nuclear missile tests which will
    resume for the first time in 25 years. The US has promptly responded by also
    announcing the start of it's own nuclear tests, and launching an ICBM test from
    Vandenberg Space Force Base. Ukraine has largely held the line today, and
    inflicted heavy losses on Russian forces. Russian forces are making slow
    progress through the streets of Pokrovsk, and Ukrainian armed forces are
    considering a retreat from Myrnohrad. Venezuela finds itself still under a
    larger threat, with the US striking and sinking another boat today.
