    The US Secretary of War has announced that the US is on the brink of war
    "like 1939," and must be ready to engage and destroy the enemies of the United
    States at a moment's notice. These statements come as tensions run high with
    China and Russia, and conflict may become inevitable within the next few years
    in Europe and Asia. Russia has given authority to fuel companies to mix alcohol
    with gasoline to try and stretch Russian fuel supplies farther if possible,
    which is a desperate last ditch plan. Meanwhile Tehran has now started water
    rationing as water supplies are at their absolute limit. India has pledged that
    Operation Sindoor is simply on hold, and actions against Pakistan could begin
    again at any moment.
