    UKRAINE BE PUTTING A WHIPPING ON THE RUSSIAN PORTS AND STUFF MAN, LIKE
    DAMN DUDE. LLTLSA!
  description: |-
    Russian forces have been slammed by major Ukrainian attakcs overnight
    which have hit the port of Tuapse and other key infrastructure around the
    entirety of the border regions near ukraine. Russia is now stalling temporarily
    in the Pokrovsk area as Russian forces have not consolidated their postioins and
    are vulnerable to counterattack. Israel and Iran appear to be preparing for
    conflict once more, as sources report the nuclear program was hardly damaged and
    the Iranians and Israelis appear to be amassing weapons for another round of
    battle.
