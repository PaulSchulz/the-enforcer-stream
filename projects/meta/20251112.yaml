    Russia is collapsing internaly as oil export orders dry up rapidly and major
    Ukrainian attacks rain havoc and destruction on key refineries, depots, ports,
    and other facilities in Russia daily. Russia has begun year-round mass

    multiple targets overnight including a possible Flamingo missile attack on the
    port of Tuapse which caused significant damage to the port and it's abilities.
    Pakistan has declared war on India, and is now mobilizing forces to their
    borders after an explosion in Islamabad killed a dozen citizens; Modi will hold
    a security council meeting tomorrow inh India. Thialand has completely revoked
    the cambodia peace treaty and is now preparing for war after 2 Thai soldiers
    were wounded from a landmine. Venezuela now mobilizes their armed forces to
    prepare for Guerrilla war.
