    MAJOR RUSSIAN PORT DESTROYED, US DECLARES OPERATIONS ON VENEZUELA! Breaking
    War News W The Enforcer
  morse: |
    UKRAINE WAS NOT PLAYING GAMES TODAY WITH THAT ATTACK ON NOVOROSSIYSK.
    LLTLSA!
  description: |
    A major Ukrainian attack has destroyed most if not all of the port
    facilities around Novorossiysk including the port air defense network, oil
    storage areas, piers, barracks, and other critical infrastructure on the
    harbor-front. Multiple refineries have been laid to waste by other Ukrainian
    attacks across the country, with Flamingo cruise missiles being used en-masse
    inside of Russia, with most making it to their target except for one shot down
    over Oryol. Germany has announced national conscription while Poland heavily
    considers a similar declaration. The US has declared a military operation
    against Venezuela, with a large number of ships and aircraft within the area; we
    are awaiting direct strikes in the next few days. Ukraine has inflicted heavy
    casualties against Russian forces today, while China has threatened Japan over
    possible involvement in the defense of Taiwan.
