    IRAN SIEZES SHIP IN STRAIT OF HORMUZ, STRIKES ON VENEZUELA IMMINENT! Breaking
    War News The Enforcer

    IRAN IS PLAYING WITH FIRE, AND THE US IS ABOUT TO FIRE ON CAP'N CRACK SPARROW.
    LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Iran seizes the Talara, an oil tanker near the strait of Hormuz, effectively
    starting a blockade of the vital passageway. Currently the United States has not
    made a response, but the ongoing actions by Iran greatly increase the chance of
    a new war between the US, Israel, and Iran. The US has announced that they have
    made a decision on Venezuela, although the decision is not being made public at
    the moment. US forces are being amassed in the area in large numbers, making it
    clear that strikes are coming wildly soon. Ukrainian forces have held Pokrovsk
    and Myrnohrad, and the port of Novorossiysk has practically been destroyed to
    the point of non-operation. China is now telling their citizens not to travel to
    Japan as tensions rise.
