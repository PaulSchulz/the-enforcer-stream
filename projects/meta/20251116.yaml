    ANY HOUR NOW VENEZUELA IS GOING TO GET HIT BY US FORCES, SO WE ARE ON STANDBY.
    LLTLSA!
  description: |
    A massive Ukrainian drone attack has destroyed large facilities within major
    cities throughout Russia causing major damage to key facilities throughout the
    country. Russia has attempted to respond to the Novorossiysk attack by firing
    Khinzal hypersonic missiles into Ukraine; a large number were shot down by
    Patriot air defense batteries. War with Venezuela now appears to be imminent,
    and happening within a very short frame of time from now. US forces are heavily
    active within the area, and Venezuelan reistance is broadcasting messages that
    Maduro's time in power is soon to end. Ukrainian forces engage the Russians in
    heavy battle in Kupyansk and Pokrovsk, with Russian forces making minimal to no
    gains in both major battles over the course of the day. China is ramping up it's
    violent rhetoric against the State of Japan, threatening to "cut the head," of
    the Prime Minister; a grave threat at a minimum. Iran has broadcasted a message
    that they believe war is coming in December, while at the same time announcing
    the seizure of the Talara and the beginning of an effective blockade.
