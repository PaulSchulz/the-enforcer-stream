    SO UHHHH... WE ARE NOW TALKING TO THE DUDE WE JUST DECLARED A TERRORIST,
    OK. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Russian cities have been relentlessly attacked and heavily damaged by Ukrainian
    drone attacks which occured overnight. Russian steel mills, refineries, and
    other facilities have been utterly destroyed. Russia is running critically low
    on manpower, and is now offering massive sign-on bonuses to try and keep even a
    small stream of volunteers. Denmark's airspace is being violated again by
    Russian drones, with the skies around Aalborg being closed due to the airspace
    incursion. US officials continue to declare Iran's actions on the Talara
    illegal, as they also now stall on conducting action against Venezuela. China is
    still ramping up pressure on Japan, and Pakistan now declares they are ready to
    fight.
