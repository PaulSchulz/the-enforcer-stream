    RUSSIA ATTACKS POLISH RAILWAYS, RUSSIAN ARMS INDUSTRY COLLAPSES! Breaking
    War News W The Enforcer
  morse: |
    NATO CANNOT ALLOW THIS TO CONTINUE, WE ARE
    PUTTING LIVES IN JEOPARDY BY OUR INACTION. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Poland has announced that Russia planted explosives on a Polish railroad and
    detonated the bombs with the hope they would derail a train and cause massive
    damage and loss of life, according to Polish investigators. This is the first
    official armed attack deliberately conducted by Russian on NATO soil, with the
    future uncertain about a NATO response. Meanwhile the Russian arms industry is
    collapsing from the strain of the lack of imports and shipments of arms to the
    Russian army has put exports on backorder. A Radiation alert was sent out in the
    Zhytomyr oblast earlier today, while Russian forces have been unable to take
    Myrnohrad. The US is still conducting heavy actions around Venezuela, with the
    future uncertain about whether the US will strike them or not.
