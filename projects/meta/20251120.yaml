    RUSSIA ATTACKS BRITISH SHIP, POLAND MASS-DEPLOYS TROOPS! Breaking War News
    With The Enforcer 1365

  description: |
    Russia attacked a British aircraft off the coast of Scotland earlier today,
    by shining a high powered laser into the cockpit of the aircraft in an attempt
    to blind the pilots and airmen of the jet. Britain has stated that the action
    was highly dangerous and provocative. Poland has now declared Russia a terrorist
    state, and pledges that they will respond not just diplomatically but with
    action. Poland has shut down the last Russian consulate in Gdansk. Poland is now
    deploying 10,000 troops, roughly 3 brigades of men, to defend critical
    infrastructure around the country. The US has attempted to create an
    capitulation-style peace deal for the war in Ukraine; Ukraine rightfully
    rejected the proposal. Us exercises are still occurring around Venezuela, while
    the messaging from the US about the fate of the tropical country remains
    confused.
