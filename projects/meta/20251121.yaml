  description: |
    Ukraine has conducted a massive attack on the Russian forces inside of
    Crimea, causing significant damage to the Russian airbase at Saky, and other
    reports of damage are coming through. Russia has declared the Ukrainian
    government a criminal organization, and has pledged Russia will continue until
    all objectives of the SMO are achieved. The US has conducted bombing drills
    against Venezuela, while the Secretary of Defense ha stated that the
    announcement of the Terra Del Sol as a terrorist organization has "opened up
    options," for plans against Venezuela. Currently 20% of the US navy that is
    currently deployed is within 2nd Fleet's command. Ukraine has held it's ground
    today, inflicting heavy losses onto the Russian Federation. Iran has also made
    confusing statements about their foreign policy initiatives.
