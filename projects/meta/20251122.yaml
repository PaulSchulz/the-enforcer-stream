    Ukraine has conducted another heavy attack on to the Russian Federation
    overnight, causing serious damage to the Russia's abilities in Crimea, and
    knocking out more refineries again. The Russians have stated they accept the US
    peace plan, while the plan has been condemned by practically every person
    regardless of political affiliation, and national alleigance. The Ukrainians
    have been given an ultimatum; accept US demands or face a complete cut off of US
    support of all types. Meanwhile the US has declared a NOTAM over the whole of
    Venezuela, as US forces are poised to strike. While that's happening the
    President is once again claiming he will talk to Maduro. Ukrainian forces have
    continuned to heroically hold their lines today; inflicting heavy casualties
    while the future of foreign support from the US to Ukraine hangs in the balance.
