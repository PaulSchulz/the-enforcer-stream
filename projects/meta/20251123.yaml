    WHAT THE HELL DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE PLAN IS A RUSSIAN PLAN? AND THEN
    THEY AREN'T SURE? WTH? LLTLSA!
  description: |
    The Netherlands have become the first nation to open fire on Russian drones
    over their territory, after drones were spotted in the airspace overnight. Dutch
    air defense forces fired at the drones, and while it appears some hits may have
    been scored the drone then veered off into the distance and was not later found.
    Ukrainian forces have attacked into Russian again, hitting key targets,
    including an oil facility on the Crimean coast. The US is preparing action on
    Venezuela, and is considering some last actions before direct strikes. US SOF
    teams are on the move in Brazil, and US forces are heavily active near the
    coast. Due to massive pushback the peace plan is being backed off of; and it was
    possibly a Russian surrender plan according to some statements by US officials.
