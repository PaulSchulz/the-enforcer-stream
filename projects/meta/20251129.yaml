    Two Russian shadow tankers have exploded off the coast of Turkey, highly
    likely ukrainian attacks, with the ships burning out of control and the crews of
    both vessels abandoning ship. the tankers are now adrift at sea, and engulfed in
    flames. They are expected to sink if no firefighting attempts are made. A
    Russian UR-100N carrying an Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle has exploded at
    the Yasny testing range. This is the loss and failure of another of Russia's
    more modern nuclear weapons, showing a complete lack of quality control and also
    upkeep of their nuclear arsenal. Meanwhile The US is saying that strikes on
    Venezuela could come soon, while Maduro's plane was seen near the Brazilian
    border today. Ukrainian forces have held the line inflicting heavy losses on the
    Russians, while Ukraine is dealing with internal issues as Andriy Yermak has
    stepped down from office.
