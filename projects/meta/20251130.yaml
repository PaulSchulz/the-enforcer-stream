    UPRISING ERUPTS INSIDE IRAN, DRONES LAUNCHED AT KERCH BRIDGE! Breaking War News
    W The Enforcer 1375
  morse: |
    IRAN IS LOOKING LIKE IT'S DEALING WITH A LITTLE TOO
    MANY ISSUES, ALONG WITH RUSSIA LOL. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Uprisings erupt in central Iran as the Iranian government appears to be in a
    weakened condition as the nation continues to be in an incredibly precarious
    position. Iran's water resevoirs have run so low that dams have now been put out
    of operation. Iran also is conducting attacks on the Kurdistan regions of Iran,
    while the Iranian government is also denying the acts. Ukrainian drones have
    conducted massive attacks on Russia, with a large number of them flying toward
    the Kerch Bridge area. Russia is attempting to shoot down the drones, although
    the Russians seem to be doing poorly again. Ukrainian forces have held the lines
    against the Russian forces. Venezuela is now deploying MLRS systems on the coast
    while the US declares strikes are coming soon. The US has also shut down
    Venezuela's airspace.
