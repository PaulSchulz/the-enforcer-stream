    Ukraine is now launching a global war on the Russian shadow
    tanker fleet after an oil tanker near Senegal was hit and now sinking off of the
    coast. Russia claims Ukraine conducted the attack which was 5500km away from
    Ukraine, the longest range strike by a drone in history if correct. Iran is
    preparing for war with Israel as well as the Iranian people as the rebellion
    near Shiraz continues. Israel begins strikes on Hamas forces in Rafah, and
    appears to be preparing for conflict with Hezbollah once more. Russia begins
    evacuations of their citizens from Iran, as the possibility of strikes appears
    up in the air. Ukraine has held the line and inflicted heavy casaulties on
    Russian forces over the day.
