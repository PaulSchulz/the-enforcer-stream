    UKRAINE SLAUGHTERS RUSSIAN SHADOW TANKERS, PUTIN NUKES PEACE DEAL! Breaking
    War News W/ The Enforcer
  morse: |
    RUSSIA IS SAYING NO AGAIN. HOW MANY TIMES DO WE LOOK LIKE A
    FOOL UNTIL WE SAY ENOUGH? LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Ukraine has begun an endless campaign against Russian shadow tankers,
    hitting a 4th tanker today in the Black Sea. Russia has now trapped itself in a
    corner as it has rejected another peace deal offering from the US, and has made
    it clear they will only accept unconditional surrender by Ukraine and largely
    the west. NATO is saying there is a possibility of preemptive strikes against
    The Russian Federation, but it is unknown if these strikes would ever be
    conducted under realistic scenarios. Turkey is now incensed about the attacks
    near their coast, and stating that the waters of the Black Sea are no longer
    safe. The US is now saying strikes will begin on Venezuela on land.
