    The Russian Federation's banks warn of complete economic collpase as they
    are now sitting on a powderkeg of overdue loans that is 3 times larger than the
    2008 financial crisis in the United States. A s a result of this, the Russian
    Federation has cancelled a massive transportation project with China that may
    have served as an economic lifeline; they now don't even have the chance to get
    enough money to make this happen. Kazakhstan is also considering shutting down a
    major Russian-Chinese pipeline due to US sanctions. Medvedev has threatened NATO
    and it's complete destruction at teh hands of the Russians, once again showing
    violent rhetoric from Russia. Russia has also shown diplomatic support to
    Venezuela, stating they are ready to fight the US. The US is still vowing to
    strike Venezuela soon. Israeli forces came under fire in the Rafah city area
    today. Ukrainian forces hold the lines and inlfict heavy casualties on Russian
    forces.
