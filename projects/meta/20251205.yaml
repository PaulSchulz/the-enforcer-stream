    Russia has attempted and failed to assasinate Zelensky while he was
    conducting affairs in Ireland, as Irish authorities stated that several drones
    of a clearly militaristic design appeared at the airport several minutes after
    the arrival and securing of the Presidential Jet in Ireland. Russia is taking
    major losses in Pokrovsk, Myrnohrad, Kupyansk and the Konstyantinivka front.
    Ukraine forces, in a rare ocassion on film, engaged Russian forces in direct
    firefights. Meanwhile Poland is delcaring a major security meeting that will be
    classified, while Belgium is now getting cold feet entirely on liquidating
    Russian assets. China has deployed a large number of China Coast Guard cutters
    in all of their waters; a large show of force possibly. the US is cinducting
    significant escelations against Venezuela, most likely in an attempt to start
    the conflict.
