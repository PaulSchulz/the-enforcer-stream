    I GOT TO SAY THAT IT IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE KEEP SEEING
    WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW. LLTDSA!

    Russian forces have been severely hit with top commanders likely killed when
    Ukrainian special forces conducted a raid 50 miles behind the lines in the city
    of Skadovsk. this attack appears to show a lack of Russian recon and defenses
    along the coastline which may become a vital weakpoint for Ukraine to conduct
    precise strikes through. Russian air forces bombed the major city of Belgorod
    today, hitting a substation and knocking power out to a large area of the city.
    India is now appearing to align with Russia as they announce they will continue
    to purchase Russian oil; India has completely rejoined the BRICS alliance at
    large. The Gerald R Ford is now underway once more in the eastern carribbean.
