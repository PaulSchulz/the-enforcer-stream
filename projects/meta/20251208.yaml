  description: |
    A massive war has now broken out in Thailand and Cambodia, with Cambodian
    forces conducting a massive barrage of rocket fire and artillery on the Thai
    side of the border. Thai air forces have now conducted 8 airstrikes inside of
    Cambodia, including one on a casino which was alleged to be a command post for
    the Cambodian army. Turkish forces have begin invasions of the SDF controlled
    regions of Syria in the northeast, while Syrian Interim Government forces are
    also moving towards SDF territory. It appears at the moment Turkey is aiming to
    destroy the SDF, and possibly hand over control of the area to the SIG.
    meanwhile Saudi Forces are now rolling into Eastern Yemen, to support and assist
    the Yemeni government against the Houthi forces in control of the western region
    of the country. this is due to the situation weakening for the Yemeni and their
    need of assistance. An ongoing coup is happening in the Ivory Coast state of
    Benin, with the Beninese forces attempting to stop the Coup. The French armed
    forces are also involved in supporting government forces. China has also locked
    onto Japanese fighter jets near the area of the Senkaku islands, which the
    Japanese SDF spoke about officially today.
