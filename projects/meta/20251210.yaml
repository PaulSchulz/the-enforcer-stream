    Lithuania has declared a state of emergency due to ongoing airspace
    violations from the Russian Deferation and the Republic of Belarus. The
    Netherlands also scrambled F-35s to repsond to another airspace violation,
    although the craft were not found. Russia has stated that they are at war with
    Europe, and will only see victory when Europe is entirely defeated. Putin has
    also stated today that Russia will stop at absolutely nothing except total
    victory in Ukraine. Thai air forces have pummeled cambodian positions throughout
    the day with major battles raging along the border for 48 hours. The Thai
    government has made it clear they will not bow to any form of US pressure until
    Cambodia no longer poses a threat to the Kingdom. Cambodia responded with large
    rocket barrages across the border, with civilian and military casualties being
    reported on both sides. several Chinese and Russian aircraft flew into the South
    Korean ADIZ today, prompting a state of high alert. Ukraine has made it clear
    that they will not cede any territory, and Russia will get the "hole of a
    bagel."
