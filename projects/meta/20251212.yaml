    the NATO Secretary General has warned that Russia is already preparing for a
    war with Europe, and that NATO must take every action it can while there is
    still time to prepare for the looming war. The Russian Federation has continued
    to push forward with it's unattainable goal of victory in Ukraine while
    beginning the process of bringing reservists into the military to build up
    available forces in Ukraine and to also prepare for actions against Europe. A
    crucial refinery was hit in Yaroslavl, it is one of the largest refineries in
    the whole of Russia. Ukraine also hit a massive oil platform in the Caspian sea.
    Japan and China currently are seeing record-high tensions since World War 2,
    with Japan now building missile defense bases in their southern Island chain,
    while the US conducted a show of force flight with the Japanese today. Russia
    asked the UK how the British soldier died in Ukraine, and has threatened that
    they may strike British forces as reprisal. The US is now conducting a blockade
    against Venezuela.
