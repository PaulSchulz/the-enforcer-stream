    Russia warns of Ukraine conducting major missile attacks on nearly all of
    their major cities after Ukraine has announced that the Sapsan missile is now
    entering mass production, and will be joining the Neptune, flamingo, and other
    long range missiles in attacks against the Russian Federation. Russia has been
    hit heavily overnight with major attacks, crippling more refineries through the
    country causing major issues once again for a failing economy. Europe has
    immobilized Russian assets, stopping the assets from being given back to Russian
    unless if they give reparations to Ukraine. This is a major step towards
    liquidation of the assets and the provision of them funding to Ukraine. The US
    President has claimed that there is now a ceasefire in Thailand, but fighting is
    still ongoing according to video and picture evidence. Russia claims to have
    taken Kupyansk, so Zelensky went down there and fact checked the Russian Army.
    The US is once again claiming that they are going to bomb Venezuela, but the
    President clarified that they aren't bombing Venezuela, they are just bombing
    stuff that happens to be in Venezuela.
