    OUR CONDOLENCES TO THE SOLDIERS OF OUR NATION WHO HAVE DIED PROTECTING THE

  description: |
    US Forces have been ambushed in Palmyra, Syria with 3 US soldiers now
    reported dead. The United States has announced immediate reciprocal action
    against ISIS who was responsible for the ambush earlier in the day. Large
    numbers of US forces by land and air have been conducting major actions in the
    area in response, hoping to destroy the ISIS cell responsible for the heinous
    attack outright. Ukraine has launched a new counteroffensive in Kupyansk against
    Russian forces, with the counteroffensive appearing to have wildly positive
    outcomes in the opening hours; Russian forces are now threatened with
    encirclement in the city. Russia has also been hit heavily overnight by a major
    drone and missile attack conducted by Ukraine which hit a broad variety of
    targets throughout the entirety of western Russia. The US is still keeping a
    larger air presence around Venezuela. The next day has come and passed in
    Thailand, and it has become clear that there is no ceasefire that was going into
    effect, with Thai and Cambodian forces conducting significant offensives
    throughout the day, with the Thai Air Force striking key targets and command
    posts at their leisure.
