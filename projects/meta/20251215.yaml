    SYRIA LOOKS TO BE IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE RIGHT NOW, AND ONLY
    GETTING WORSE. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Syria has devolved into chaos as armed insurgent groups are now conducting
    attacks against US and Syrian forces throughout the whole of central Syria,
    while attacks that have occured in the US and Australia seem to have connections
    to the group. The US has vowed that there will be major attacks and reprisals
    for the 3 US soldiers who were slain in the ambush of Palmyra. Ukrainian
    missiles have rained down on Moscow overnight, with Russian air defense
    panicking and hurridly attempting to shoot down the missiles before any major
    damage could be made; the damage was done nontheless. Heavy fighting continues
    on the Thai-Cambodian border as a ceasefire does not appear to be in sight
    currently, and Cambodian forces are being relentlessly destroyed by Thai
    airstrikes. Germany is preparing for more defensive efforts in preparation with
    a war against Russia, and the US is moving more forces into the Carribean, with
    strikes uncertain.
