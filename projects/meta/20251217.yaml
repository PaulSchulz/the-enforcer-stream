  description: |
    An armed revolt appears to be occuring in Southern Iran; several Iranian
    soldiers and security personnel have been killed in Kerman, while reports of an
    armed uprising are emerging from Iranshahr are also forming. Meanwhile Ukrainian
    drones slipped under Russian defenses at the port of Novorossiysk and heavily
    damaged a Kilo-Class submarine. The Russians are attempting to cover up the
    damage but the results appear to be clear. Thailand and Cambodia are also
    carrying on the war for another 2 days, with heavy fighting still occuring along
    the entire border. Thai forces have advanced in limited areas across the border,
    and are holding heights in the hills in the Sa Keao region. The US has formally
    declared a blockade on Venezuela, with all Oil ships attempting to enter the
    country being barred from doing so this point onwards. Ukraine has inflicted
    heavy losses on Russian forces, and has once again held the line.
