    RUSSIA PENS UP THE WHOLE FLEET IN ONE SPOT AND THEN SOMEHOW A UKRAINIAN
    DRONE GETS IN. LMAO LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Russia has blockaded their own navy today in Novorossyisk, blocking the only
    exit out of the naval port in Novorossiysk. Oil prices per barrel in Russia are
    collapsing, reaching the lowest level historically seen. Russia also claims that
    Ukraine is failing to retake Kupyansk, although the Ukrainians have liberated
    the entire city, with a small amount of Russians trapped in the center.
    Venezuela has announced their warships will be escorting ships in and out of the
    US blockade, which highly increase the chance of direct fire by either side. The
    US has a large amount of activity off the coast of Venezuela, and appears to be
    ready to strike. Thailand has conducted offensives and taken ground along the
    border, with Cambodia receiving training from China in the midst of the
    fighting. Putin has called Europe swine, and is claiming that the west has no
    culture.
