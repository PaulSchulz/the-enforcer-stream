    The US has launched a major campaign Operation Hawkeye Strike with over 70
    targets being hit within Syria over a short period of time. The actions appear
    to be entrely based around airstrikes from the US Air Force along with missile
    strikes by US Army Artillery forces in SDF controlled territory. Currently it is
    unknown how effective the strikes are, but they are significant. A massive
    Russian tanker has been hit 2,000 KM away from Ukraine in the Meditteranean and
    is burning profusely; it is unknown if the ship will sink. Meanwhile more runs
    on the Russian bank are ongoing and the situation is worsening. The
    Thai-Cambodia war is still ongoing, with fighting along the whole border.
