    RUSSIA IS GETTING THEIR CHRISTMAS EARLY WITH THE GIFT OF LOOMING CALLAPSE AND
    DEFEAT! WHAT A TREAT! LLTLSA

  description: |
    Moscow is under major alerts for incoming missiles and drones as Ukraine
    launches a major attack again tonight with explosions and major damage being
    reported in cities throughout Russia. The Belbek airfield was hit overnight,
    with Russia losing a SU-27 in the midst of the attack. US forces have seized a
    Chinese VLCC in international waters today, which was carrying 2 million barrels
    of crude. It does not appear that Venezuela escorted the vessel, and no repsonse
    has been made from the Chinese. Meanwhile the Thai continue to bomb Cambodian
    forces clearly showing they have the open advantage in the fight. An explosion
    rocked Tallinn earlier today, with Estonia investigating the possible actors
    involved in the attack. Ukraine has held the lines and inflicted significant
    casualties on Russian forces over the course of the day.
