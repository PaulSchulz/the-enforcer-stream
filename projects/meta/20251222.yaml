    US forces are currently engaged in a hot pursuit of an Iranian oil tanker
    which has broken through the US blockade and is refusing to stop and be boarded.
    The pursuit has been ongoing for hours, with the Iranian ship still not
    stopping. Israel is now warning the US that it believes that the Islamic
    Republic of Iran is preparing for a preemptive strikes against the Israelis,
    with Iranian forces now basing within western Iran from what intelligence can
    confirm. The United States appears to not be confirming Israel to conduct
    strikes at the moment. Meanwhile Sweden has boarded a Russian ship the Adler to
    inspect the ship for possible weapons shipments. Ukraine has held the line and
    inflicted massive losses on the Russian forces, and stopped most advances, if
    not pushed them back. The Thai-Cambodia casino war continues, with Thai forces
    laying it heavy on Cambodia, Cambodia appears to receive support form China.
