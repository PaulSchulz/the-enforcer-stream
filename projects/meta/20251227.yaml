    POLAND SHOOTS DOWN RUSSIAN DRONES, BELARUS ESCALATES WAR! Breaking War News
    With The Enforcer
  morse: |
    WE ARE STILL ON THE VERY BRINK OF A SHOOTING WAR WITH RUSSIA, IT'S A KNIFE'S
    EDGE. LLTLSA!
  description: |

    Polish Air Forces have engaged and shot down a Russian Orlan-10 drone in the
    Baltic, as hours before dozens of unidentified objects flew into Polish airspace
    from Belarus which led to the scrambling of air and ground defense forces.
    Estonia has issued shoot-on-sight orders for Russian Army and Border Guard
    personnel who may attempt to cross the Estonian border. Satellite pictures of
    Eastern Belarus confirm that an Oreshnik facility has been erected on their
    territory, and appear operational at the moment. Belarus is now actively
    participating in the war against Ukraine, allowing Russia to use their nation as
    a launching base for drones into Ukraine; Ukraine has vowed immediate action.
    The Thai-Cambodia conflict is still raging, although a ceasefire was supposed to
    go in effect. Thai forces appear to be building up for full scale offensives
    into the country. In the Middle East Israel is stating that Iran's hostile
    nature cannot be tolerated insinuating future attacks, while striking Hezbollah
    and Quds forces in Lebanon. US forces appear to still be growing in preparation
    for a Venezuela attack, although the US admin's resolve for strikes appears to
    be wavering. Ukraine has conducted a counteroffensive at the northern flank of
    pokrovsk, and is holding Kupyansk. Russian cavalry is becoming more common, and
    Russian has made small gains on the Zaporizhzhia front.
