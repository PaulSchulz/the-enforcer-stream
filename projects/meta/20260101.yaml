      Iranian cities are burning along with key government offices and IRGC
      headquarters as rebels are now taking control of areas inside Iran and forcing
      the Iranian govenrment into retreat. The city of Ramhormoz in the southwestern
      region of the country has been reported to fall to the active rebellion, with
      others in equally precarious positions. Iranian forces are now opening fire
      across the whole country, and it is highly likely the situation will only
      further deteriorate. Russian air defenses were overwhelmed today throughout the
      entirety of Russia, with key facilites including refineries and oil depots being
      destoryed through the attacks. Finland has seized a Russian ship and is
      conducting an investigation after another undersea cable was snapped today in
      mysterious circumstances. China has announced the conclusion of Operation
      Justice Mission 2025, Taiwan remains on high alert. The US has declared that
      Russia has lied and fabricated the claim about Putin;s private residence being
      attacked, now claiming Russia is the one stopping peace. Meanwhile Ukrainian
      forces inflicted heavy losses, and stopped the Russian advances on most fronts
      altogether.
