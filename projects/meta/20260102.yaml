    Iran declares martial law as the uprising is now taking control of several
    cities and city centers thorughout the country, with some of the rebels breaking
    into government facilities and equipping themselves with firearms. The Iranian
    government has now declared martial law in most of the cities where the
    rebellion is growing, and are firing upon the crowds with live ammunition. The
    Rebellion is currently showing no signs of stopping and has grown larger once
    again overnight, with calls for a major demonstration and uprising to be
    conducted in central Tehran. Putin has lodged a formal demand with the US to
    stop the pursuit of the Bella 1 oil tanker, as it is now claiming to be a
    Russian oil vessel, and subject to the protection of Russia. The US seems to be
    heavily considering backing off, although other sources have stated that the US
    considers the tanker to be "stateless." The US has declared that the actions of
    China are unneccisarily escelatory , and that the Chinese should start
    deescelating. Ukraine has held the lines today, and inflicted more losses on the
    Russians. Finland also found the the seized Russian vessel was carrying
    sanctioned cargo.
