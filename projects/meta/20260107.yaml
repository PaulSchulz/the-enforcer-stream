    A large Iranian city near to the border of Iraq has officially fallen to
    revolutionary forces in the country. Internal Security forces are now turning
    against the Iranian government and are beginning to join the Revolution, a
    telling sign that the government of Iran is largely awaiting it's doom as it has
    nearly no internal support now. The elements of the IRGC still loyal, are firing 
    into the crowds throughout most cities where the revolution is ongoing. Israel
    has been given the greenlight to conduct strikes on Hezbollah, while the Syrian
    civil war appears to be starting again, with heavy fighting in the city of
    Alleppo. The US is preparing to board the Bella 1 tanker, but it has now been
    reported that Russian submarines and surface vessles are converging to escort
    the vessel; it is believed it may have been carrying Russian weapons which is
    the reason for it's staunch evasion as well as it's newfound Russian protection.
    Venezuela has apparently made an agreement to give the US a sizeable amount of
    oil, although the government still appears to be hostile to the US. The US is
    also threatening to take greenland, which is causing a major rift in NATO.
    Thailand and Cambodia have restarted as a war for a third time, striking
    Cambodian forces with airstrikes and mortar fire. Ukraine has inflcited heavy
    losses on Russian forces, and hit key targets throughout the country.
