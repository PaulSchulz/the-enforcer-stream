    Thew Bella 1 tanker has been seized by US Special Forces north of the UK
    earlier today, after the ship attempted to violate a US blockade near Venezuela.
    Russian naval forces were reported to be in the area, but did not take any
    action to stop the US from taking the ship. Russian government officials are
    demanding that strikes be conducted against US ships throughout the world to
    repsond to the US actions. An Iranian coup appears to be building as police
    officers of the Iranian government are now vowing to stop any further actions
    supporting the government, and that tomorrow and the next day will be
    significant days; insinuating a coup. The SYrian Civil War is in full swing as
    battles are raging in Aleppo, and the SIG and SDF are now mobilizing for larger
    confrontations.
