    HONESTLY IT ACTUALLY SHOWS WHAT RUSSIA IS ABOUT THE FACT THEY SAT THERE AND DID NOTHING.
    LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Russia has fired at least 6 Oreshnik IRBM missiles onto the city of Lviv,
    which is only about 30 miles to the Polish border. These Missiles were used on a
    conventional capacity, but there is an understanding that more are to be fired
    possibly soon. Ukraine has counterattacked by hitting and destroying the
    electrical grid. Iran opens fire on Protestors/ Revolutionaries all across the
    country, after they turned off the internet nationwide. We will be covering all
    of these developments and others live on air in this special breaking news
    stream.
