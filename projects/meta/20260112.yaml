  description: |
    Russian oil rigs in the Caspian sea have been heavily damaged if not knocked out
    after a major Ukrainian drone attack hit the area. Ukrainian drones have also
    landed hits in Rostov and Voronezh once more. An attack was also conducted in
    Moscow knocking out a comms system. Meanwhile the Iranians have continued their
    massacres against the Iranian public, with the US stating they will help the
    Iranian people; there have been many statements affirming and contradicting the
    claim. Iran has threatened US forces in the meantime, with Iran feeling that
    their government stability is threatened. The US has also threatened war with
    Cuba over the course of the day, stating they better negotiate or else.
