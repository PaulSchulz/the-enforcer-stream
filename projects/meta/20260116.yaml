    RUSSIA WANTS TO BE A REALLY BIG BOY AND THEY KEEP GETTING KNOCKED AROUND A
    LITTLE. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Major Ukrainian attacks have caused major damage inside of Russia, knocking
    out electrical substations, oil refineries, military installations, and other
    vital systems of the Russian economy and war machine. Russia has taken massive
    losses on the frontline, while taking very little to no gains on the entirety of
    the frontlines. Russia has also made statements that they are seeing the
    international situationg deteriorating, and also has threatened Europe about
    growing militarization. The US has seized another Russian shadow tanker in the
    Carribean, taking the vessel under US control. The US is attempting to move
    forces into the middle east while the Iranian government is continuing to use
    live ammo against demonstrators. It seems that most of the protests- uprisings
    have been put down due to the brutal actions of the Iranian government. Europe
    and the US still find themselves in high tensions overt the possibility of the
    annexation of Greenland.
