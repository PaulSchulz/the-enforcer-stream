    JOKE WITH EACH PASSING DAY. HIT EM! LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Moscow has suffered major damage at the hands of a massive Ukrainian drone
    strike which has caused another massive energy blackout and causing a roaring
    and unstoppable fire at a major chemical plant with firefighting efforts proving
    fruitless. US forces are evacuating from the Middle East, showing the
    possibility of further strikes rising. The USS George H. W. Bush is now being
    diverted into the area of the Mediterranean, showing a possible move to CENTCOM
    in the future. Iran is continuing to conduct violent actions against
    demonstrators although statements from the US seem to indicate otherwise.
    Ukraine has held their lines and inflicted massive casualties onto Russian armed
    forces. The US has also issued a NOTAM for a broader area of central and south
    america.
