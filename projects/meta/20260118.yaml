#  IRAN RIOTS REIGNITE AMID REGIME CHANGE, MASSIVE BLACKOUTS IN MOSCOW!
#  Breaking War News The Enforcer
#  morse: |
#  IRAN JUST KEEPS DESCENDING INTO A SPIRAL OF WORSE AND WORSE DEALINGS. NOT GOOD
#  AT ALL. LLTLSA!
#  description: |
#  The riots and uprisings have resurged inside of Iran after the US has called
#  for regime changes inside of the country, with more strike forces moving into
#  the area. Currently Iran is still taking armed and violent action against the
#  protestors and rebels, with snipers firing into the crowds over the course of
#  the day again. The Israelis have also urged for the US to hold back until they
#  can conduct larger strikes; jeopardizing the possible success of the revolution
#  on the ground. Massive blackouts have gripped the outer suburbs of Moscow, as
#  Ukrainian drones continue to hit electrical infrastructure knocking out massive
#  parts of the electrical grid. Ukraine has inflicted heavy losses on the Russian
#  armed forces, and has held their lines today. Meanwhile the US has now
#  heightened tensions even farther with Europe over Greenland, with Europe now
#  suspending a trade deal with the US, and sending even more forces to the region.
#  The US has also levied tarriffs against Europe for not complying with the
#  draconian demands.
