  description: |
    Syrian Democratic Forces have officially signed an agreement with the Jolani
    Regime of Syria, marking a complete capitulation of a US backed ally in
    northeastern Syria, and the possible end of US military presence within Syria.
    Jolani's forces began to break free and release large swaths of ISIS prisoners
    that wer in SDF custody, allowing them to return back into the general populace
    to conduct untold actions in the future. Heavy fighting was conducted all the
    way up until the last moment when the SDF surrendered to Jolani's Regime.
    Meanwhile, Zelensky has claimed that the Russian Federation is now preparing to
    target nuclear power plants inside of Ukraine. The Ukrainian armed forces have
    dealth significant damage to the Russian army over the day, and have stopped
    most if not all advances that were attempted. Meanwhile US carriers are still a
    good distance away from reaching the Middle East while strike capable forces of
    the US Air Force are now moving to Centcom. Iran has made it clear that any
    attacks will be met with a major response.
