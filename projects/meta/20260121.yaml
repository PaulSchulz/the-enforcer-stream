    Ukraine has launched major attacks on the Russian Federation, hitting major
    cities and ammo dumps within occupied territories and around the border regions.
    A major ammo explosion has suffered a major blow near to the city of Donetsk.
    The Russian Federation is still dealing with the worsening economic situation
    and no advances near the front adding to the bitterness of the continued high
    losses. Russia has targeted and sit substations providing power to the Chernobyl
    nuclear powerplant area, leaving the powerplant completely cut off from the
    grid. Ukraine has stated that this is a crisis along with the IAEA. Meanwhile
    Protests are still ongoing in Iran. The SDF's remaining froces have rebelled
    against the unconditional surredner and are fighting the Jolani Regime in the
    northeastern area of the country. ISIS fighters are being released from prisons
    in the thousands, and terror attacks are already being claimed by ISIS within
    the region.
