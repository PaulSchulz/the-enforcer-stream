    News W/ The Enforcer 1428

    OH YEAH LET’S GO IT LOOKS LIKE THEY BLEW UP A PORT AND GOT THAT THING COOKING
    UP. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Ukrainian forces landed major hits on the major Russian oil
    port of Taman, causing the largest oil port in the Black Sea to go offline which
    will cuase tremendous damage to the Russian Federation's economic abilities as
    the war drags on. Iran is mobilizing their armed forces as public dissent within
    Tehran remains steady, and Impending US strikes look to be a higher certainty.
    Ukrainian armed forces have held their lines and inflicted heavy losses onto the
    Russian armed forces without the Russian gaining any ground. Meanwhile ISIS
    raised it's flag over the city of Raqqa in central Syria today, showing that the
    Jolani regime has near or direct connections to the group. The US has backed off
    of it's threats on Greenland, as European leaders in Davos made it clear that
    Europe cna go it alone without the US and would be more than fine with that
    arrangement if necessary.
