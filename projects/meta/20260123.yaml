  morse: |
    LOOKS LIKE THE US IS PREPARING TO CONDUCT STRIKES ON IRAN. I HOPE THEY DO THAT
    SOON. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    A large US force is now building up inside of the middle east, with all
    indications pointing towards strikes on Iran being imminent. Currently Israel
    and US forces are preparing air defense forces in the area, with further strike
    forces being moved in. The USS Abraham Lincoln is also expected to arrive within
    the next 24 hours, with the USS George H W Bush also expected to arrive soon.
    France has seized the "Grinch," Oil Tanker near French waters earlier today, a
    Russian shadow tanker. Ukrainian forces are continuing to hold their lines, with
    Russia once again taking massive losses with little to no frontline gains, and
    footage emerging showing that Ukrainian long range strikes in Russia have been
    successful.
