    RUSSIAN CITIES DEVASTATED IN MASS STRIKES, KHAMENEI MISSING IN IRAN! Breaking

    UKRAINE SEEKS TO CLEAN THE FRONT OF RUSSIAN SOLDIERS BY MEANS OF HELLFIRE.
    LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Russia cities have been devastated by the largest and most destructive
    Ukrainian drone attack seen in the entire war in Ukraine. Russian power grids
    have been wiped off the face of the earth, while other major strategic sites are
    burning in behemoth infernos. Russia's armies have been incapable of making
    breakthroughs on the frontlines, and has suffered eye-watering losses over
    another day of defeat. In Iran the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, has gone
    missing with some believing that he has already arrived at a secure bunker in
    Lavizan as the nation awaits US strikes. Major supply and troop transports
    numbering in the dozens have flown into the region over the past 24 hours. China
    has pruged the entire Central Military Commision (CMC) after bringing the last
    two pre-purge holdouts under arrest for charges of corruption and unspeakable
    crimes against the state. This underlines the growing animosity between the PLA
    and CCP leadership in China, and the worrying concern that the PLA may back an
    anti-Xi coup d' etat.
