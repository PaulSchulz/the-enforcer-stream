    CHINA JUST HAD THE BIGGEST SECURITY BLUNDER OF THEIR HISTORY THANKS TO THIS!
    LLTLSA!
  description: |
    The People's Republic of China has stated that Zhang Youxia, the
    vice-chairman of the central military commission has given secrets to the US on
    their nuclear arsenal. It was also stated that they general was alleged to
    accept bribes for government positions including the minister of defense, which
    are vital roles for China's military abilities. This will result in a massive
    loss of strategic deterrent abilities for the Chinese, and a far faster response
    time by US forces in the event of a nuclear attack. Iran has threatened to
    attack and sink the USS Abraham Lincoln that has now officially entered the
    CENTCOM Area of responsibility. The US has also secured large batteries of air
    defense throughout the region, and is ready for defensive actions. Ukraine has
    hit large number od targets in Russia overnight and has also continued to hold
    back Russian armed forces.
