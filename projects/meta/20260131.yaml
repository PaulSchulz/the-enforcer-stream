    Satellite Imargery has unveiled a disturbing discovery at the Natanz and
    Isfahan nuclear facilities. structures have been rebuilt at the facilities,
    indicating that recovery and salvage have been underway for some time. This also
    shows that the Iranian nuclear program is still operational, and working towards
    nuclear weaponry. At this moment, it is also unclear how long their nuclear
    research has been going since Operation Midnight Hammer, and how close they are
    to being able to create a testable nuclear weapon. Iran has made it clear that
    they will not be conducting any negotiations with the US on nuclear issues, and
    would find it preferrable to go to war instead. US forces are still moving into
    the region with strikes coming in the future. The Russian oil giant, Lukoil, has
    officially liquidated all of it's international holdings today, signalling the
    company was close to bankruptcy and had to restructure to keep the mother
    company in Russia alive. China has has a major security leak today as someone
    took photos of a secretive aircraft after sneaking into a Chinese airfield.
    Ukraine has slammed the Russian forces today, and stopped most if not all
    frontline advances. Panama has also kicked the Chinese holding firms out of the
    2 major ports in their country, with China now vowing a response.
