    IRAN PREPARES FOR WAR WITH US, RUSSIAN TROOPS NEAR FINNISH BORDER! Breaking War
    News W/ The Enforcer
  morse: |
    IRAN IS PRETENDING LIKE THEY MIGHT
    NEGOTIATE TO BUY THEMSELVES SOME TIME. LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Iran has stated that they are ready for war with the United States, and
    european officials speaking with Iran have confirmed that their intention is a
    direct armed confrontation with the US and Israel in the near future. Meanwhile
    Iranian negotiators are planning to run interference and buy Iran time by
    speaking with the US in Ankara, although intelligence officials from multiple
    nations have made it clear these talks will result in no forward progress.
    Russian troops hvae begun to deploy along the finnish border, which is a
    concerning development showing that the high tensions in the region are now
    forming into possible war plans by Russia against NATO. Ukrainian forces have
    conducted heavy fighting over the course of the day, and have stopped all
    Russian advances and inflicted heavy casualties. The US is continuing to put
    further pressure on Cuba, and has moved more SOF command C-130J Commando II
    aircraft to Diego Garcia; possible suggesting a high likely -hood of special
    forces being used on Iran if strikes become inevitable.
