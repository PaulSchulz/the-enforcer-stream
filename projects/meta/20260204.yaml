    F-35C Fighters of the USS Abraham Lincoln have attacked and destroyed an
    Iranian 129. It was confirmed by Iran and US CENTCOM that the drone had been
    attacked and destroyed with air to air weaponry. Earlier in the day, Iran
    attempted to board and seize a US tanker in the Strait of Hormuz, leading to an
    armed standoff by the US navy and Iranian navies as the tanker was escorted out
    of the strait. Iran is now stating that they will back out of peace talks and
    move forward with their plans, ready to strike the US in the meantime. Major
    attacks have been conducted by Ukraine on Russian border regions, leading to
    Kursk, Bryansk, Belgorod all losing power from the major attacks. The Ukrainian
    armed forces have held the line sand stopped any further advances by the Russian
    Army. Germany and Poland have found signs of Russian spying and sabotage within
    their armed forces and governments.
