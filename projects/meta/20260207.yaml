    IRAN IS REALLY MESSING AROUND A LITTLE TOO MUCH. HOW ATHESE GOOFBALLS GETTING
    AWAY? LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Iran has deployed a massive fleet of fast attack boats in the Strait of Hormuz,
    largely appearing to either exercise control over the area, or attempting to
    conduct a full blockade. This comes after US-Iran talks failed this morning,
    with Iran not budging ona single point in the negotiations. Iran has guaranteed
    that they will talk about talking further, but that does not guarantee any sort
    of a real deal. Meanwhile Iran has conducted ballistic missile test firings
    today, and have also conducted more surveillance flights. A larger army barracks
    has exploded in Tehran in the past few hours, with a veil of uncertainty arising
    as to why the barracks exploded; possible intelligence actions. A drone has
    crashed into a Polish base today, and is veing investigated by military police.
    China has been alleged to be conducting underground nuclear tests; in violation
    of standing treaties banning nuclear weapons tests. Ukraine has launched a mjor
    attakc on Russia, landing hits in some areas. A Russian general had an
    assasination attempt conducted on him, and is in critical condition. Ukraine has
    held the line, and stopped any Russian advances over the course of the day.
