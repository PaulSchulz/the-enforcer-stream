    Major Russian cities including the Port of Novorossiysk and the city of
    Belgorod have been utterly devastated from last night's attacks, with Ukraine
    conducting a day long barrage of the city of Belgorod. Ukraine was also able to
    land major hits in Bryansk and the Saratov region, making this one of the most
    damaging attacks of the war. Ukraine has delcared a nuclear crisis. Russia is
    hammering the electrical substations providing power to all of Ukraine's nuclear
    powerplants, and for this reason all reactors have been brought offline to stop
    a dire nuclear disaster from forming. Meanwhile Iran is continuing to state that
    they will not allow any concessions in talks, and they are ready to deal major
    attacks to US forces in the Middle East. Large number of US Air Force flights
    are still ongoing, and it appears that strikes would be highly likely in the
    long term. China has also unveiled a new anti-satellite weapon capable of
    knocking out starlink satellites. Ukraine has held the frontline, inflicting
    heavy losses on Russian forces.
