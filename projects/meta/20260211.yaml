    Iran has deployed a large number of Electronic warfare systems in the Strait
    of Hormuz along with drone launchers as large fires continue to break out in
    Tehran with no verifiable source. The US is still attempting to negotiate with
    Iran, and has issued a warning to all ships not to pass through the Strait of
    Hormuz. Meanwhile heavy US airlifts are still ongoing to the Middle East
    carrying air defenses and other equipment necessary for US military operations.
    US forces in SOUTHCOM AOR seized another Russian shadow tanker off of the coast
    of Venezuela today for allegedy violating sanctions. Meanwhile Cuba may be
    getting support from the communist Chinese soon, while the US is continuing to
    squeeze the Cubans to put immense pressure on the Cuban government. Ukrainian
    forces landed more hits inside of Russia, burning a oil refinery in Volgograd.
    Ukrainian forces are conducting a minor offensive in Zaporizhzhia, and are
    taking ground.
