    RUSSIAN FORCES PANIC AS UKRAINE ADVANCES, US NAVY BLOCKADES CUBA! Breaking War
    News W/ The Enforcer
  morse: |
    THE RUSSIAN ARMY IS COLLAPSING, AND THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY IS TOO, VERY NICE!
    LLTLSA!
  description: |
    Russian forces are now in a full panic across the frontlines as Ukrainian
    forces are now making major advances after a total Russian frontline collapse
    due to a complete blackout of all communication systems the Russian army was
    using. Currently Russian forces are falling back in a heavily disorganized
    state, and Ukraine has achieved the upper hand by the Russian's own undoing.
    Ukraine has also hit major targets in Russia, including a refinery, a GRAU
    arsenal, and the city of Volgograd among many other targets. Ukrainian Flamingo
    missiles were used in the overnight attack. The US NAVY is currently conducting
    a blockade of Cuba, with Russian and China vowing support to the Cubans to
    attempt to break the US blockade and to return fuel resources to the ailing
    island nation. Iran is mobilizing forces in the street, but has also been
    reported that there will be another month given for negotiations.
