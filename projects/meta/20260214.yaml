    The US is currently preparing major air attacks on Iran, involving
    multi-week long air campaigns to destroy Iran's military and administrative
    capabilities. Iran is conducting large air defense activities over the city of
    Isfahan, and are continuing to prepare for an eventual and inevitable war with
    the United States. Still, negotiations are ongoing between the US and Iran,
    although the negotiatiation probably will not be making any progress at all. The
    US has also announced the deployment of the Gerald R Ford Carrier group to the
    CENTCOM AOR. Meanwhile the largest refinery in Cuba has caught on fire and is
    burning heavily, while the US continues to blockade Cuba. Meanwhile In Europe
    multiple EU countries are beginning to distance themselves from the US, and NATO
    has announced that they lost a wargame against Ukraine due to heavy drone usage
    by the Ukrainian armed forces. Ukraine has held the line, and is still pushing
    back Russian forces. Major hits were recorded in some Russian cities overnight.
