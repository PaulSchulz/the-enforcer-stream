    Israel has ordered final wartime preperations, and put the IDF on high alert
    as the Israeli armed forces are currently awaiting strikes by US forces on Iran
    which are expected to be soon. US airlifts have been conducted at a record scale
    over the past 24 hours, and the Gerald R Ford is currently transiting the Strait
    of Gibraltar. Iran is continuing to conduct further military operations around
    the Strait of Hormuz and are soon to launch anti-ship missiles within the next
    24 hours. Uprisings are growing further in Iran even under intense pressure.
    Russia is suffering from further financial collapse as another Russian oil
    company has declared bankruptcy over the course of the day. Russia is also
    possibly preparing to conduct a mass mobilization wihich was the reason Telegram
    and Whatsapp were banned in the country. Ukraine is hammering Russia heavily and
    is pushing Russia even further back, with 200 square kilometers of ground
    retaken.
