    The Russian vessel Stoiky has joined the Iranian exercise "Control The
    Strait," as the tensions over the looming war reach a fever pitch. Iranian air
    defense and militias near the Strait of Hormuz are also growing to prepare to
    buy enough time to attempt laying a minefield. Poland has issued a statement
    that all Polish citizens must leave Iran immediately as evacuation after these
    next few days may be impossible. US assets, including CIA aircraft have also
    arrived in the area. Belarus has begun a draft near the Suwalki Gap, suggesting
    the training of territorial defense forces in preparation for a larger war.
    Russia has also been hit again by Ukrainian drone attacks in the northern
    region. Yoon Suk-Yeol has been sentenced to life in prison for his attempted
    coup.
