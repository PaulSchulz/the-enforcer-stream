    IRAN IS FACING DOWN A WAR AND ANOTHER OPEN REVOLT ALL IN THE SAME TIME. HAVE
    FUN! LLTLSA!
  description: |
    The Iranian military has started major deployments along the western border
    near Iraq, which has led to analysts saying that Iran is deploying to prpeare
    for strikes on Israel and US forces. Iran has also announced a new anti ship
    missile in the ongoing military exercises, one that is claimed to be able to hit
    US warships (they say that about every weapon they have). Meanwhile the Internal
    situation is continuing to deteriorate as Iranian students and citizens are
    openly protesting and revolting against the government again. Iranian internaol
    forces are firing into the crowds in an attempt to disperse them although this
    time their resolve seems much more great than the last. US forces are still
    flooding into the region, with so many forces present some have had to deploy
    and operate out of the Balkans and the Island of Crete, to even find a location
    close to the Middle East. Ukraine has inflicted heavy losses onto Russia in
    overnight attacks, Russia is also still losing ground in slow-rolling Ukrainian
    offensives and heavy losses also accompany the loss of ground.
