    Iran has been found to be restarting their nuclear weapons program according
    to all US Intelligence, with Iran working to expand their undergound facilities.
    Iran is also working to kickstart most of their uranium enrichment capabilities,
    except for those at pickaxe mountain which are believed to have been still
    operational. Currently over 250 combat aircraft of the US Air Force are
    currently in the Middle East. A US Vessel was fired upon by the Cuban Armed
    Forces within 1 mile of the Cuban coast, it is unknown as to the purpose of the
    vessel's presence, but 4 Americans have been killed with another 6 wounded and
    receiving treatment in Cuba. Russia is also claimed to be preparing some sort of
    plan for a radiological incident and then blame the event on the Ukrainian
    State. Russia is still loosing ground along the entire front, and is making no
    gains. Russia has also had top analysts come forward making the claim that
    Russia is all but defeated already.
