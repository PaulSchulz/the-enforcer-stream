#  Pakistan declared war on Afghanistan after surprise attacks were conducted
#  by the Taliban along the border. Pakistani forces are now conducting heavy
#  artillery barrages and airstrikes on Taliban positions and Afghan cities, while
#  the Taliban is conducting heavy fighting along the border with rocket artillery
#  support. Pakistan has further stated that the Afghan nation is a puppet of India
#  and they will not stop fighting until the Taliban government has been reduced to
#  nothing. Today, a Russian drone flew over the Charles De Gaulle, a French
#  Nuclear Aircraft Carrier, while it was moored in Malmo Sweden. Swedish
#  authorities ran the drone off, but it seems that the issued has incensed the
#  French and Swedish governments. Russia has also announced they do not plan on
#  ending the war any time soon, even as their economy is failing and frontlines
#  are receeding. Iran has completely refused any US talking points in Geneva
#  today, and the US is now ready to conduct strikes on Iran. Israel is already
#  bombing Hezbollah forces to put them out of the fight before the war begins.
