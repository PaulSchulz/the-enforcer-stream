    Explosions have rocked Iranian missile facilities on the outskirts of Tehran
    while large swarms of fighter jets could be heard near the border with Iraq.
    Iran has declared that they will conduct the "doomsday option" of firing
    everything at Israle if it appears they will not survive a US attack. The IAEA
    claims that the enriched uranium has been hidden in the Isfahan facility, and
    have buried the entrances in a large amount of soil. Sweden has confirmed that
    the drone that flew over the French carrier was in fact a Russian drone.
    Pakistani forces are now advancing into Afghanistan, and taking over military
    outposts on the other side of the border. Taliban factions have now started
    infighting, with firefights breaking out in Kabul. Ukraine has held the line and
    inflicted heavy losses onto the Russian armed forces.
