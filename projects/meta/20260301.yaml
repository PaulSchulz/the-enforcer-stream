      War rages between the allied coalition and the Islamic republic of Iran
      after opening US and Israeli strikes caused significant damage to the Islamic
      Republic of Iran in the opening minutes of the attack. Currently, Iran has fired
      a near continuous volley of missiles towards US forces, Israel, and many allied
      gulf state nations, while the US and Israel have continued larger waves of
      attacks on Iranian government and military facilities and personnel. The Iranian
      navy has now announced a blockade of the Strait of Hormuz. With all ships now
      stopping the transit of the vital passageway the price of crude oil will rise
      with each passing day. It is unclear whether breaking the blockade is a high
      priority. We will be covering the ongoing conflict live on air as the situation
      continues to evolve.
